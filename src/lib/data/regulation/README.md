## Key Insights from GRC Expert Analysis

### 1. Risk-Based Approach
The regulation uses a **four-tier pyramid**:
- **Unacceptable Risk** → Prohibited (Chapter II)
- **High Risk** → Strict requirements (Chapter III + Annexes)
- **Limited Risk** → Transparency obligations (Chapter IV)
- **Minimal Risk** → Voluntary codes (Chapter X)

### 2. Most Critical Annexes

**Annex III (High-Risk Systems)** - Your classification checklist:
1. Biometrics (if legally permitted)
2. Critical infrastructure
3. Education & vocational training
4. Employment & worker management
5. Essential services (healthcare, credit scoring, insurance)
6. Law enforcement (if legally permitted)
7. Migration, asylum, border control
8. Justice & democratic processes

**Annex IV (Technical Documentation)** - What you must maintain:
- General system description and intended purpose
- Development, training, testing methodology
- Data governance and datasets used
- Human oversight measures
- Accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity measures
- Risk management system

### 3. Governance Structure

**European Level:**
- European AI Board (Article 64+)
- European Artificial Intelligence Office (coordination)

**National Level:**
- Market surveillance authorities
- Notifying authorities
- Notified bodies (conformity assessment)

### 4. Timeline Reality Check

| Date | What Happens | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2 Feb 2025** | Prohibited practices ban | Immediate compliance required |
| **2 Aug 2025** | GPAI obligations active | Foundation model providers must comply |
| **2 Aug 2026** | High-risk for new systems | New high-risk AI must be compliant |
| **2 Aug 2027** | Full application | All high-risk AI must be compliant |

### 5. Financial Exposure

**Tier 1 Violations (Prohibited Practices):**
- €35 million OR 7% of global annual turnover (whichever is higher)

**Tier 2 Violations (High-Risk Non-Compliance):**
- €15 million OR 3% of global annual turnover

**Tier 3 Violations (Information Obligations):**
- €7.5 million OR 1.5% of global annual turnover

## Expert Recommendations

### For Course Development:
1. **Start broad, go deep** - Foundation → Specific obligations
2. **Use case studies** - Each prohibition and high-risk category deserves real examples
3. **Interactive elements** - Risk assessment exercises using Annex III
4. **Practical tools** - Documentation templates based on Annex IV
5. **Regular updates** - Monitor delegated acts and implementing regulations

### Common Pitfalls to Address:
1. ❌ "We're not in the EU" → Territorial scope includes non-EU providers if output used in EU
2. ❌ "We're just using AI, not providing" → Deployers have significant obligations too
3. ❌ "Our AI isn't high-risk" → Check Annex III carefully, many surprised
4. ❌ "We have time" → Prohibited practices enforceable Feb 2025
5. ❌ "It's just about compliance" → Strategic opportunity for trustworthy AI leadership

2. **Compliance Roadmap** - Prioritize based on timelines and risk
3. **Documentation System** - Establish technical documentation processes
4. **Training Rollout** - Use these sections to build role-based training
5. **Ongoing Monitoring** - Track delegated acts and guidance documents
