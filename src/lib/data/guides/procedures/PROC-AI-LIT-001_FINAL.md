## 2. REGULATORY BASIS

### 2.1 EU AI Act Article 4: AI Literacy

**Article 4 - Obligations:**

1. **Providers and deployers of AI systems shall take measures to ensure, to their best extent, a sufficient level of AI literacy of their staff and other persons dealing with the operation and use of AI systems on their behalf.**

2. **Taking into account their respective tasks and circumstances and the context in which the AI systems are to be used, the AI literacy measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure that those persons have, to the extent necessary:**
   - **(a) Technical knowledge appropriate to their tasks**
   - **(b) Experience appropriate to their tasks**
   - **(c) Education and training appropriate to their tasks**
   - **(d) Understanding of the context in which AI systems are used**
   - **(e) Awareness of the persons or groups of persons affected by AI systems**

### 2.2 Key Regulatory Principles

| Principle | Description | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Universal Application** | Article 4 applies to ALL AI systems, not just high-risk | Training program covers all AI systems used |
| **Role-Based Approach** | Training must be appropriate to each person's role | Competency framework with 4 levels tailored to roles |
| **Context Awareness** | Training must cover the specific context of AI system use | Training includes use case scenarios and limitations |
| **Affected Persons** | Training must cover awareness of impacted stakeholders | Training includes fundamental rights and bias awareness |
| **Best Extent** | Organizations must do their best to ensure literacy | Documented training efforts, tracking, and continuous improvement |

### 2.3 European Commission Guidance (February 2025)

The European Commission Q&A on AI Literacy clarifies:

- **"Other persons"** means those broadly under organizational remit, including contractors, service providers, and clients who operate systems on behalf of the organization
- **No formal certifications required**, but organizations should keep records of training efforts
- **"It depends"** - training level depends on role in AI value chain, risk level of systems, and current staff knowledge
- **Reading instructions for use is insufficient** in most cases
- **No direct fines** for Article 4 violations, but lack of training may be an aggravating factor in enforcement of other AI Act violations
- **Enforcement begins 2 August 2026** by national market surveillance authorities

### 2.4 Related Standards

- **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** - AI Management System (Clause 7.2: Competence)
- **ISO/IEC 23894:2023** - AI Risk Management

## 6. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

### PHASE 1: TRAINING NEEDS ASSESSMENT

#### Step 1.1: Identify Personnel Requiring AI Literacy Training (Control LIT-001)

**When:** Annually + when new AI systems deployed + when roles change

**Who:** AI L&D Manager + Department Managers + Chief AI Officer

**How:**

1. **Compile Personnel Inventory**
   - List all employees (full-time, part-time, temporary)
   - List all contractors and consultants
   - List all service providers operating AI systems on behalf of the organization
   - List all clients/partners who deploy AI systems provided by the organization
   - Document role, department, current responsibilities
   - Use HRIS and contractor management systems to ensure completeness

2. **Identify AI System Touchpoints**
   - Review AI System Register (from PROC-AI-CLS-001)
   - For each AI system, identify:
     - Who develops it? (Providers)
     - Who operates it? (Deployers)
     - Who monitors it? (Technical staff)
     - Who uses its outputs? (End users)
     - Who makes decisions based on it? (Decision-makers)
     - Who is affected by it? (Awareness needed)
   - Create AI System Touchpoint Matrix (Form LIT-TNA-001)

3. **Map Personnel to AI Systems**
   - Cross-reference personnel inventory with AI system touchpoints
   - Assign each person to one or more AI systems they interact with
   - Document nature of interaction (develop, deploy, use, affected, govern)
   - Identify personnel with no AI touchpoints (Level 1 only)

4. **Determine Required Competency Levels**
   - Apply Role-to-Competency Mapping (Section 5.3)
   - For each person, determine minimum required competency level
   - Document rationale (e.g., "Customer service rep using AI chatbot → Level 2")
   - Consider special cases requiring higher competency

5. **Document Training Population**
   - Complete Training Needs Assessment - Personnel Inventory (REC-LIT-TNA-001)
   - Summarize findings:
     - Total personnel requiring training: [X]
     - Level 1 required: [X]
     - Level 2 required: [X]
     - Level 3 required: [X]
     - Level 4 required: [X]
   - Obtain approval from Department Managers and Chief AI Officer

**Evidence Required:**
- AI System Touchpoint Matrix (Form LIT-TNA-001)
- Training Needs Assessment - Personnel Inventory (REC-LIT-TNA-001)
- Department Manager approvals

**Timing:** 2-3 weeks annually

**Quality Check:**
- All personnel accounted for (compare to HRIS headcount)
- All AI systems from register covered
- Competency levels justified and appropriate
- Special cases documented (e.g., high-risk system operators)

---

#### Step 1.2: Assess Current AI Literacy Levels (Control LIT-001)

**When:** After personnel identification; before training program design

**Who:** AI L&D Manager + Department Managers

**How:**

1. **Design Assessment Instrument**
   - Create AI Literacy Baseline Assessment (FORM-LIT-TNA-002)
   - Include questions across all four competency levels
   - Include self-assessment section (perceived competency)
   - Include knowledge test section (actual competency)
   - Test questions should map to learning objectives in Section 5.2

   **Example Question Categories:**
   - Basic AI concepts (Level 1)
   - Organizational AI systems awareness (Level 1)
   - EU AI Act requirements (Level 1-2)
   - Operational procedures (Level 2)
   - Technical knowledge (Level 3)
   - Governance and strategy (Level 4)

2. **Administer Baseline Assessment**
   - Distribute assessment to all identified personnel
   - Provide 2 weeks for completion
   - Use online survey tool (anonymous or identified based on policy)
   - Send reminders at 1 week and 3 days before deadline
   - Achieve minimum 90% response rate
   - Follow up with non-respondents

3. **Analyze Assessment Results**
   - Score all assessments using standardized rubric
   - Calculate current competency level for each person:
     - Level 1: 0-25% correct
     - Level 2: 26-50% correct
     - Level 3: 51-75% correct
     - Level 4: 76-100% correct
   - Compare current level to required level
   - Identify competency gaps (required > current)
   - Calculate aggregate statistics:
     - Average competency by department
     - Average competency by role
     - Most common knowledge gaps
     - Self-assessment vs. actual scores (awareness gap)

4. **Identify Priority Training Needs**
   - Prioritize based on:
     - **Priority 1:** High-risk AI system operators with large gaps
     - **Priority 2:** All personnel with competency gaps
     - **Priority 3:** Personnel at required level (refresh training)
   - Identify specific knowledge gaps requiring targeted training
   - Document common misconceptions needing correction
   - Identify exemplar employees who could mentor others

5. **Document Current State**
   - Complete Training Needs Assessment Report (RPT-LIT-TNA-001)
   - Include:
     - Baseline assessment summary statistics
     - Gap analysis (required vs. current by role)
     - Priority training needs
     - Recommended training approach
     - Resource requirements estimate
   - Present to AI Governance Committee

**Evidence Required:**
- AI Literacy Baseline Assessment (FORM-LIT-TNA-002) - completed by all personnel
- Training Needs Assessment Report (RPT-LIT-TNA-001)
- Gap analysis summary
- AI Governance Committee presentation and approval

**Timing:** 3-4 weeks

**Quality Check:**
- Minimum 90% response rate achieved
- Assessment covers all competency levels
- Gap analysis is accurate and complete
- Priority needs clearly identified and justified

---

#### Step 1.3: Define Role-Specific Learning Objectives (Control LIT-001)

**When:** After gap analysis; before curriculum development

**Who:** AI L&D Manager + Chief AI Officer + Subject Matter Experts

**How:**

1. **Review Standard Learning Objectives**
   - Start with standard learning objectives for each competency level (Section 5.2)
   - Review for applicability to organization's AI systems
   - Identify objectives requiring customization

2. **Customize for Organizational Context**
   - For each role category, refine learning objectives to include:
     - Specific AI systems they will use
     - Specific decision contexts they will encounter
     - Specific risks and limitations relevant to their work
     - Specific procedures they must follow
     - Specific affected persons they must consider

   **Example Customization:**
   - Generic Level 2 objective: "Understand how the AI system makes decisions"
