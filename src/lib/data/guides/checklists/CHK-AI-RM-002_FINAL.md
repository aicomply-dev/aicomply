## Purpose

This checklist provides a systematic method for evaluating the effectiveness of risk controls implemented for AI systems. Use this checklist to verify that controls are adequately designed, properly implemented, and operating effectively to mitigate identified risks.

## Instructions

1. Complete this checklist periodically for all AI systems with implemented controls
2. Frequency: High-Risk AI (quarterly), Limited/Minimal Risk (annually)
3. Document evidence for each control evaluated
4. Address any gaps or deficiencies identified
5. Update risk assessments based on findings
