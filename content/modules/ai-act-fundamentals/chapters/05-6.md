# Implementation Timeline

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Map all key compliance deadlines from 2024 to 2030
- Understand what provisions apply at each implementation phase
- Identify transition rules for existing AI systems
- Create a prioritised compliance roadmap for your organisation
- Distinguish between provisions with immediate effect and phased application

---

The EU AI Act follows a **phased implementation approach**, with different provisions becoming applicable at different times between 2024 and 2030. This staged rollout allows organisations time to prepare while ensuring the most harmful AI practices are addressed first.

## Legislative Timeline

| Milestone | Date | Significance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commission Proposal | 21 April 2021 | Original draft published |
| Political Agreement | 8 December 2023 | Trilogue concluded |
| Parliament Adoption | 13 March 2024 | MEPs vote to approve |
| Council Adoption | 21 May 2024 | Final approval |
| Official Journal Publication | 12 July 2024 | Legal text published |
| Entry into Force | 1 August 2024 | Regulation becomes law |

## The Six Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Entry into Force (1 August 2024)

**What happened:**
- The AI Act became legally binding as EU law
- Countdown to all application dates began
- Member States began transposing administrative requirements

**Immediate effects:**
- No direct obligations on providers/deployers yet
- Organisations should begin preparation
- Commission empowered to adopt implementing acts

---

### Phase 1: First Enforcement Date (2 February 2025)

**This is the most urgent deadline for most organisations.**

**What becomes applicable:**

| Provision | Article | Affected Parties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Prohibited Practices** | Article 5 | All AI operators globally |
| **AI Literacy** | Article 4 | All providers and deployers |
| **General Provisions** | Chapter I | All parties |

**Article 4: AI Literacy Requirement**
Providers and deployers must take measures to ensure, to their best extent possible, a sufficient level of AI literacy of their staff and other persons dealing with the operation and use of AI systems on their behalf.

> ❗ **Action Required by Feb 2, 2025:**
> 1. Complete prohibition audit of all AI systems
> 2. Cease any prohibited AI practices immediately
> 3. Implement AI literacy training programmes
> 4. Document compliance with Article 4

### Phase 2: GPAI and Governance (2 August 2025)

**What becomes applicable:**

| Provision | Articles | Affected Parties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GPAI Model Obligations** | 51-56 | GPAI model providers |
| **Systemic Risk GPAI** | 51-52 | Providers of high-capability GPAI |
| **Governance Structure** | 64-70 | EU institutions, Member States |
| **Penalties Framework** | 99-101 | Enforcement authorities |
| **Confidentiality** | 78 | All parties |
| **AI Office** | 64 | Commission |
| **AI Board** | 65 | Member State representatives |

**Key GPAI Obligations Taking Effect:**

| Requirement | Systemic Risk | All GPAI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Technical documentation | **Yes** | Yes |
| Instructions and information | **Yes** | Yes |
| Copyright policy | **Yes** | Yes |
| Training content summary | **Yes** | Yes |
| Model evaluation | **Yes** | No |
| Adversarial testing | **Yes** | No |
| Incident reporting | **Yes** | No |
| Cybersecurity measures | **Yes** | No |

> 💡 **Expert Insight:** If you develop or deploy Large Language Models, foundation models, or other general-purpose AI, this date is your primary compliance deadline for GPAI-specific requirements.

---

### Phase 3: Full Application (2 August 2026)

**The primary compliance deadline for high-risk AI systems.**

**What becomes applicable:**

| Provision | Articles | Affected Parties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **High-Risk AI Requirements** | 8-15 | High-risk AI providers |
| **Provider Obligations** | 16-22 | All providers |
| **Deployer Obligations** | 26 | All deployers |
| **Importer/Distributor Obligations** | 23-25 | Importers, distributors |
| **Conformity Assessment** | 43-49 | High-risk AI providers |
| **EU Database Registration** | 71 | High-risk AI providers |
| **Transparency Obligations** | 50 | Limited-risk AI providers |
| **Notified Bodies** | 28-39 | Conformity assessment bodies |
| **Market Surveillance** | 74-77 | National authorities |
| **Post-Market Monitoring** | 72 | Providers |

**What providers of high-risk AI must have ready:**
- Complete risk management system (Article 9)
- Data governance procedures (Article 10)
- Technical documentation (Article 11, Annex IV)
- Record-keeping/logging capabilities (Article 12)
- Transparency information for deployers (Article 13)
- Human oversight measures (Article 14)
- Accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity measures (Article 15)
- Quality management system (Article 17)
- Completed conformity assessment
- CE marking affixed
- EU database registration

---

### Phase 4: Annex I Products (2 August 2027)

**Extended deadline for AI in safety-critical products.**

**What becomes applicable:**
Full high-risk AI requirements for AI systems that are:
- Safety components of products covered by Annex I legislation
- Subject to third-party conformity assessment under that legislation

**Why the extension?**
These products already have existing regulatory frameworks. The extra year allows alignment with product development cycles and integration with existing conformity assessment processes.

**Affected sectors:**
- Medical devices (Regulation 2017/745)
- In-vitro diagnostics (Regulation 2017/746)
- Motor vehicles (Regulation 2019/2144)
- Aviation (Regulation 2018/1139)
- Machinery (Regulation 2023/1230)
- Other Annex I sectors

---

### Phase 5: Large-Scale IT Systems (31 December 2030)

**Final deadline for EU operational systems.**

**What becomes applicable:**
Full compliance for AI systems that are components of EU large-scale IT systems listed in Annex X, including:
- Schengen Information System (SIS)
- Visa Information System (VIS)
- Eurodac
- Entry/Exit System (EES)
- European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS)
- European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS-TCN)

**Why the long timeline?**
These are massive, mission-critical systems requiring careful integration of AI Act requirements without disrupting essential EU border and security functions.

## Transition Rules for Existing AI Systems

The AI Act includes **transition provisions** for AI systems already on the market:

### Existing High-Risk AI (Article 111(1))
High-risk AI systems already placed on market or put into service before 2 August 2026 may continue operating, BUT:
- Must comply if **significantly changed** after that date
- Must comply by **2 August 2027** in any case (one-year grace period)

### Existing GPAI Models (Article 111(2))
GPAI models already on market before 2 August 2025:
- Must comply with GPAI obligations within **12 months** (by 2 August 2026)

### Public Sector AI (Article 111(3))
High-risk AI systems used by public authorities:
- Same rules as private sector
- No special extensions for government use

> ⚠️ **No Transition for Prohibited Practices:** There is absolutely no transition period for prohibited AI practices. All prohibited systems must cease by February 2, 2025, regardless of when deployed.
