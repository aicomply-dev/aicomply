# Prohibited AI Practices

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Identify and explain all eight categories of prohibited AI practices
- Understand the specific conditions that trigger each prohibition
- Recognize the narrow exceptions that exist for certain prohibitions
- Conduct an internal audit to identify potentially prohibited AI
- Understand the severe penalties and enforcement timeline

---

**Article 5** establishes the AI Act's "red lines"—eight categories of AI practices so harmful to fundamental rights, democracy, and human dignity that they are **completely banned**. There is no compliance pathway for prohibited practices; they simply cannot exist in the EU market.

> ❗ **CRITICAL DEADLINE:** Prohibited AI practices must cease by **February 2, 2025**. This is the first enforcement date under the AI Act. Organizations must complete their prohibition audit immediately.

## Understanding the Prohibition Structure

Each prohibition in Article 5 has a specific structure:

1. **Conduct:** What the AI system does
2. **Conditions:** Circumstances that trigger the prohibition
3. **Harm threshold:** Level of harm required (if any)
4. **Exceptions:** Narrow carve-outs (some prohibitions only)

## The Eight Prohibited Categories

[diagram:prohibited-practices]

### 1. Subliminal and Manipulative Techniques (Article 5(1)(a))

**What is prohibited:**
AI systems that deploy subliminal techniques beyond a person's consciousness, OR purposefully manipulative or deceptive techniques.

**Conditions for prohibition:**
- The objective OR effect must be to materially distort behaviour
- Must impair the ability to make an informed decision
- Must cause or be reasonably likely to cause significant harm

**Example Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Prohibited? | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI using subliminal audio to encourage purchases | **Yes** | Subliminal technique distorting consumer behaviour |
| Personalised advertising based on preferences | No | Not subliminal; user aware of advertising |
| AI chatbot using dark patterns to prevent cancellation | **Likely Yes** | Manipulative technique distorting behaviour |
| AI recommendation showing relevant products | No | Not manipulation; user retains informed choice |

> 💡 **Expert Insight:** The key distinction is whether the technique operates "beyond consciousness" or is "purposefully manipulative." Persuasion through transparent means is permitted; hidden manipulation is not.

---

### 2. Exploitation of Vulnerabilities (Article 5(1)(b))

**What is prohibited:**
AI systems that exploit vulnerabilities of specific persons or groups due to:
- Age (children, elderly)
- Disability
- Specific social or economic situation

**Conditions for prohibition:**
- Must materially distort the behaviour of a person or group
- Must cause or be reasonably likely to cause significant harm

**Example Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Prohibited? | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI targeting gambling ads to debt-ridden individuals | **Yes** | Exploits economic vulnerability |
| AI toy manipulating children into purchases | **Yes** | Exploits age-related vulnerability |
| Accessibility AI helping disabled users navigate | No | Assists rather than exploits |
| AI providing financial education to low-income users | No | Helps rather than exploits vulnerability |

---

### 3. Social Scoring (Article 5(1)(c))

**What is prohibited:**
AI systems for evaluating or classifying natural persons or groups based on social behaviour or personal/personality characteristics, where the social score leads to:
- Detrimental treatment in **unrelated contexts**, OR
- Treatment that is **unjustified or disproportionate** to the behaviour

**Key nuances:**
- Applies to **both public authorities AND private entities**
- The prohibition is about the **consequences** of scoring, not scoring itself
- Legitimate credit scoring based on financial history remains permitted

**Example Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Prohibited? | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System denying housing based on social media activity | **Yes** | Unrelated context punishment |
| Credit score based on financial repayment history | No | Related context, proportionate use |
| Employee rating affecting unrelated healthcare access | **Yes** | Unrelated context |
| Loyalty programme with tiered benefits | No | Proportionate to customer relationship |

---

### 4. Predictive Policing Based Solely on Profiling (Article 5(1)(d))

**What is prohibited:**
AI systems making risk assessments to predict whether a person will commit a criminal offence, based **solely on**:
- Profiling, OR
- Personality traits or characteristics

**What is NOT prohibited:**
AI systems supporting human assessment based on **objective, verifiable facts directly linked to criminal activity**.

**Example Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Prohibited? | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI predicting criminality from personality tests | **Yes** | Based solely on personality traits |
| AI flagging individuals based on neighbourhood | **Yes** | Profiling without objective facts |
| AI analysing evidence from ongoing investigation | No | Based on objective, verifiable facts |
| AI identifying patterns in crime data (not individuals) | No | Not individual risk assessment |

---

### 5. Untargeted Facial Recognition Database Scraping (Article 5(1)(e))

**What is prohibited:**
AI systems that create or expand facial recognition databases through **untargeted scraping** of facial images from:
- The internet, OR
- CCTV footage

**Key elements:**
- "Untargeted" is crucial—targeted, lawful collection may be permitted
- Prevents creation of mass surveillance infrastructure
- Applies regardless of whether the database is used

> ⚠️ **Compliance Note:** Companies like Clearview AI, which scraped billions of facial images from social media, would be prohibited under this provision.

---

### 6. Emotion Recognition in Workplace and Education (Article 5(1)(f))

**What is prohibited:**
AI systems to infer emotions in:
- Workplace settings, OR
- Educational institutions

**Exceptions:**
- Medical purposes (detecting pain, fatigue for safety)
- Safety purposes (driver drowsiness detection)

**Example Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Prohibited? | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI monitoring employee mood during meetings | **Yes** | Workplace emotion inference |
| AI assessing student engagement via webcam | **Yes** | Educational emotion inference |
| AI detecting driver fatigue in trucks | No | Safety exception applies |
| AI monitoring patient pain levels in hospital | No | Medical exception applies |

---

### 7. Biometric Categorisation of Sensitive Characteristics (Article 5(1)(g))

**What is prohibited:**
Biometric categorisation systems that **individually categorise** persons by inferring:
- Race or ethnic origin
- Political opinions
- Trade union membership
- Religious or philosophical beliefs
- Sex life or sexual orientation

**Exception:**
Labelling or filtering of lawfully acquired biometric datasets, or categorisation in law enforcement context.

---

### 8. Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification in Public Spaces (Article 5(1)(h))

**What is prohibited:**
Real-time remote biometric identification (RBI) in **publicly accessible spaces** for **law enforcement purposes**.

**Narrow Exceptions (requiring strict conditions):**
1. Targeted search for **victims** of abduction, trafficking, or sexual exploitation
2. Prevention of **specific, substantial, imminent threat** to life or terrorist attack
3. Locating/identifying **suspects** of serious criminal offences (Annex II list)

**Conditions for exceptions:**
- Must be strictly necessary
- Prior judicial or independent administrative authorisation (or 48-hour post-hoc)
- Temporal, geographic, and personal scope limitations
- Cannot be sole basis for decision

**Annex II Serious Offences include:**
Terrorism, trafficking, murder, rape, armed robbery, participation in criminal organisation, environmental crimes, and others with minimum 4-year imprisonment threshold.

> 💡 **Expert Insight:** This prohibition addresses the most controversial AI application. The exceptions are so narrow that real-time facial recognition in public will remain rare and heavily controlled.

## Prohibition Self-Audit Checklist

Use this checklist to audit your AI systems:

| Question | If Yes |
| --- | --- |
| Does your AI use subliminal or hidden manipulative techniques? | **Review Article 5(1)(a)** |
| Does your AI specifically target vulnerable populations? | **Review Article 5(1)(b)** |
| Does your AI create "scores" affecting unrelated life areas? | **Review Article 5(1)(c)** |
| Does your AI predict individual criminal risk from profiles? | **Review Article 5(1)(d)** |
| Does your AI scrape facial images from internet/CCTV? | **Review Article 5(1)(e)** |
| Does your AI infer emotions at work or school? | **Review Article 5(1)(f)** |
| Does your AI categorise people by sensitive characteristics via biometrics? | **Review Article 5(1)(g)** |
| Does your AI do real-time facial recognition in public for law enforcement? | **Review Article 5(1)(h)** |

## Penalties: The Maximum Tier

Prohibited practices carry the **highest penalty tier** under Article 99:

| Entity Type | Maximum Fine |
| --- | --- |
| Large enterprises | **€35 million or 7% global turnover** (whichever higher) |
| SMEs and startups | Lower of the two amounts |

> ⚠️ **No Transition Period:** Unlike high-risk AI requirements, there is NO grace period for prohibited practices. All prohibited AI must cease by February 2, 2025—regardless of when deployed.

## Key Takeaways

- **Eight categories** of AI practices are completely prohibited under Article 5
