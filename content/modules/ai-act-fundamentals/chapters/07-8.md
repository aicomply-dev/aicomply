## The AI Act at a Glance

**What it is:** The world's first comprehensive legal framework for AI (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)

**When it applies:** Phased implementation from February 2025 through December 2030

**Who it affects:** Providers, deployers, importers, and distributors globally—if AI touches the EU market

**How it works:** Risk-based approach with four tiers determining obligations

**Why it matters:** Sets global standard for trustworthy AI; non-compliance risks severe penalties

## Essential Concepts: Quick Reference

### The Four Risk Tiers

| Tier | Description | Obligations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Prohibited** | Unacceptable risk to rights | Complete ban |
| **High-Risk** | Significant harm potential | Full compliance requirements |
| **Limited Risk** | Transparency concerns | Disclosure obligations |
| **Minimal Risk** | Low harm potential | Voluntary only |

### Key Actor Obligations

| Actor | Primary Obligation |
| --- | --- |
| **Provider** | Conformity assessment, documentation, registration, CE marking |
| **Deployer** | Appropriate use, human oversight, incident reporting |
| **Importer** | Verify provider compliance before EU market entry |
| **Distributor** | Verify CE marking and storage conditions |

### Critical Deadlines

| Date | What Happens | Your Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **2 Feb 2025** | Prohibitions enforced | Complete prohibition audit NOW |
| **2 Aug 2025** | GPAI rules apply | GPAI providers must comply |
| **2 Aug 2026** | Full application | High-risk AI must be compliant |
| **2 Aug 2027** | Annex I deadline | Product safety AI must comply |

## Key Takeaways

- The **EU AI Act** is the world's first comprehensive AI regulation, using a **risk-based approach**
- **Four risk tiers** (prohibited, high-risk, limited, minimal) determine your obligations
- **February 2, 2025** is the first critical deadline—prohibited practices must cease
- Understanding your **role** (provider, deployer, etc.) is essential for determining obligations
- The Act has **global reach**—non-EU entities are covered if AI output is used in the EU
- **Start compliance immediately**—the timeline is aggressive and penalties are severe
