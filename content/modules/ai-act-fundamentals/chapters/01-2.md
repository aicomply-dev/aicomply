# Scope and Territorial Application

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Determine whether the AI Act applies to your organization
- Understand the extraterritorial reach and "output used in the EU" rule
- Identify which activities and sectors are excluded from scope
- Navigate the nuanced open-source AI exemption
- Assess your obligations as a non-EU entity

Understanding the AI Act's scope is the essential first step in any compliance assessment. Article 2 establishes both who the regulation applies to (personal scope) and where it applies (territorial scope), with significant extraterritorial reach.

## Territorial Scope: The Three Application Scenarios

**Article 2(1) establishes three distinct scenarios** where the AI Act applies:

[diagram:territorial-scope]

### Scenario 1: EU-Based Operators (Article 2(1)(a))
Providers placing AI systems on the EU market or putting them into service in the EU, regardless of whether those providers are established in the EU or a third country.

### Scenario 2: EU-Based Deployers (Article 2(1)(b))
Deployers of AI systems that have their place of establishment or are located within the EU.

### Scenario 3: The "Output Rule" (Article 2(1)(c))
Providers and deployers of AI systems that have their place of establishment or are located in a third country, **where the output produced by the AI system is used in the Union**.

> ⚠️ **Critical Extraterritorial Provision:** Article 2(1)(c) means that a company with no EU presence whatsoever can still be subject to the AI Act if EU residents or entities use the outputs of their AI systems. This "output rule" is the broadest extraterritorial provision.

**Territorial Application Matrix**

| Scenario | Provider Location | Deployer Location | AI Output Used | AI Act Applies? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | EU or Non-EU | Any | EU Market | **Yes** |
| 2 | Any | EU | Any | **Yes** |
| 3 | Non-EU | Non-EU | In EU | **Yes** |
| 4 | Non-EU | Non-EU | Outside EU | No |

## Personal Scope: Who is Covered?

The AI Act applies to these categories of actors throughout the AI value chain:

[diagram:ai-value-chain]

**Primary Actors (Article 2(1))**

| Actor | Definition (Summary) | Primary Obligations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Provider** | Develops AI or has it developed, places on market under own name/trademark | Most extensive—conformity assessment, documentation, registration |
| **Deployer** | Uses AI under own authority (excluding personal use) | Ensure appropriate use, human oversight, incident reporting |
| **Importer** | EU entity placing non-EU provider's AI on market | Verify provider compliance before import |
| **Distributor** | Makes AI available on market (not provider/importer) | Verify conformity marking, storage conditions |
| **Authorised Representative** | Designated by non-EU provider to act on their behalf | Fulfill provider obligations on behalf of non-EU provider |
| **Product Manufacturer** | Places product containing AI on market | Ensure AI component compliance |

> 💡 **Expert Insight:** A single entity can hold multiple roles simultaneously. For example, a company that develops AI, places it on the market, and also uses it internally would be both a provider AND a deployer, with cumulative obligations.

## Activities and Sectors Excluded from Scope

**Article 2(3-12) establishes important exclusions:**

### Military and National Security Exclusion (Article 2(3))
AI systems developed or used **exclusively** for military, defence, or national security purposes are outside scope, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities.

> ⚠️ **Limitation:** This exclusion is narrow—the word "exclusively" means dual-use AI (military AND civilian) remains in scope for its civilian applications.

### Third Country Law Enforcement Cooperation (Article 2(4))
AI systems used by public authorities in third countries, or by international organisations, in the framework of law enforcement and judicial cooperation agreements with the EU.

### Research and Development Exclusion (Article 2(6))
AI systems and models used **solely** for scientific research and development are excluded, including:
- Research activities before any placement on market
- Development without intent for market placement
- Open research not leading to commercial deployment

**However:** Once an AI system transitions from R&D to deployment, full obligations apply.

### Personal/Non-Professional Use (Article 2(10))
The AI Act does not apply to natural persons using AI systems for **purely personal, non-professional** activities.

**Examples of excluded personal use:**
- Using a personal AI assistant at home
- Hobbyist AI experimentation
- Personal creative AI tools

## The Open-Source AI Exemption: A Nuanced Carve-Out

**Article 2(12)** provides a partial exemption for certain open-source AI, but it is narrower than many expect:

### What is Exempt
Free and open-source AI systems **other than high-risk AI systems** are exempt from most provider obligations if:
- Made available under an open-source licence
- Model parameters, training data methodology, and code are publicly accessible
- The entity does not place the system on the market under its name/trademark

### What is NOT Exempt (Even if Open-Source)
- **High-risk AI systems** (Annex III use cases)
- **Prohibited practices** (Article 5)
- **Transparency obligations** (Article 50)
- **GPAI model obligations** (Chapter V)

[diagram:open-source-decision-tree]

> 💡 **Expert Insight:** The open-source exemption is primarily beneficial for foundational AI research and open-source components that are integrated into larger systems by others. Once an open-source AI is deployed in a high-risk context, full obligations apply to whoever places it into that context.

## Non-EU Entities: Special Considerations

If you are located outside the EU, special rules apply:

### Authorised Representative Requirement (Article 22)
Non-EU providers of high-risk AI systems must appoint an **authorised representative** established in the EU before placing their AI on the EU market. The authorised representative must:
- Be designated in writing with defined tasks
- Possess adequate knowledge and resources
- Make documentation available to authorities
- Cooperate with enforcement activities

### The "Output Rule" in Practice
For Article 2(1)(c) to apply, the AI system's output must be **used** in the EU. This includes:
- EU residents receiving AI-generated recommendations
- EU companies using AI analysis in their operations
- AI-generated content consumed by EU audiences
- Decisions affecting EU data subjects

## Practical Compliance Implications

**Self-Assessment Questions:**

1. Where is your organization established?
2. Where are your AI systems placed on the market?
3. Who are your users/deployers and where are they located?
4. Where are the outputs of your AI systems ultimately used?
5. Do any exclusions apply (military, R&D, personal use)?
6. If open-source, does the exemption apply to your use case?

## Key Takeaways

- The AI Act has **broad territorial scope** with significant extraterritorial reach
- The "output rule" (Article 2(1)(c)) means non-EU companies may be subject to the regulation
- Exclusions exist for military/national security, R&D, and personal use—but are narrowly construed
- The open-source exemption is **partial**—high-risk, GPAI, and transparency obligations still apply
- Non-EU providers of high-risk AI must appoint an EU-based authorised representative
- Self-assessment of scope is the essential first step in any compliance programme
