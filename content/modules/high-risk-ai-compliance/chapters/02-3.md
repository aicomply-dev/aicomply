# Technical Documentation (Article 11)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Create compliant technical documentation meeting Annex IV requirements
- Structure documentation to demonstrate conformity with all high-risk AI obligations
- Maintain and update documentation throughout the AI system lifecycle
- Prepare documentation for conformity assessment and regulatory review
- Implement documentation retention and access protocols

---

Article 11 and **Annex IV** establish the comprehensive documentation requirements that form the foundation of AI Act compliance. Technical documentation is not merely administrative—it demonstrates that your high-risk AI system was designed, developed, and validated to meet all applicable requirements.

## Why Documentation Matters

### Compliance Demonstration
Technical documentation is the **primary evidence** that your AI system complies with Chapter III, Section 2 requirements. Without proper documentation, you cannot:
- Complete conformity assessment
- Obtain CE marking
- Register in the EU database
- Defend against enforcement actions

### Regulatory Access
Article 11(2) requires that documentation be **made available to competent national authorities** upon request. Inadequate documentation = potential enforcement action.

> ❗ **Critical Timing:** Technical documentation must be drawn up **BEFORE** placing the high-risk AI system on the market or putting it into service. It must be kept **up-to-date** throughout the system's lifecycle.

## Documentation Best Practices

### Structure and Organisation

| Best Practice | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Modular structure** | Organise by Annex IV category |
| **Version control** | Track all documentation changes |
| **Cross-referencing** | Link related sections clearly |
| **Index and search** | Enable quick navigation |
| **Executive summary** | Provide overview for reviewers |

### Writing Standards

**Be Specific:** Avoid vague statements; provide concrete details
**Be Complete:** Address all required elements
**Be Current:** Reflect the current state of the system
**Be Accurate:** Ensure technical accuracy
**Be Accessible:** Write for regulatory reviewer audience

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Why It's a Problem |
| --- | --- |
| Generic templates | Doesn't reflect specific system |
| Outdated information | Non-compliance with lifecycle update requirement |
| Missing elements | Incomplete compliance demonstration |
| Inaccessible storage | Authorities can't access when needed |
| No version control | Can't demonstrate change management |

## Lifecycle Documentation Updates

### When Updates Are Required

| Trigger | Action Required |
| --- | --- |
| **System modification** | Update affected sections |
| **Performance change** | Update accuracy/robustness specs |
| **New risks identified** | Update risk management section |
| **Incident occurs** | Document and update as appropriate |
| **Standards change** | Review and update standards section |

### Update Documentation Procedure

1. **Identify change** → Determine what changed
2. **Assess impact** → Which documentation sections affected?
3. **Update content** → Revise affected sections
4. **Version control** → Record change with date and reason
5. **Review** → Verify accuracy of updates
6. **Archive previous** → Retain previous versions

## Retention and Access Requirements

### Retention Period

| Actor | Retention Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Provider** | 10 years after last AI system placed on market |
| **Deployer (public sector)** | Logs retained for appropriate period |

### Access Obligations

Documentation must be made available to:
- National competent authorities (on request)
- Market surveillance authorities
- Notified bodies (during conformity assessment)

> 💡 **Expert Insight:** Consider implementing a document management system with audit trails. This demonstrates not only compliance with content requirements but also with access and update obligations.
