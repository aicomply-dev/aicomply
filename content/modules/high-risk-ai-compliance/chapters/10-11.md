# Practical Exercise: Risk Classification

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:
- Apply the AI Act's risk classification framework to real-world scenarios
- Identify prohibited, high-risk, limited risk, and minimal risk AI systems
- Reference correct articles and annexes for each classification
- Determine key compliance obligations for high-risk systems
- Document and justify classification decisions

---

This practical exercise helps you apply your knowledge of the AI Act's risk classification framework to realistic scenarios. Classification is the foundational compliance activity—it determines all subsequent obligations.

## Classification Methodology

### Step-by-Step Approach

For each AI system, follow this systematic analysis:

| Step | Question | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | Is this an AI system under Article 3(1)? | Confirm machine-based, autonomy, outputs influencing decisions |
| **2** | Is it prohibited under Article 5? | Check all eight prohibition categories |
| **3** | Is it listed in Annex III? | Check all eight high-risk domains |
| **4** | Is it a safety component in Annex I products? | Check sectoral legislation |
| **5** | Does Article 6(3) exception apply? | Check profiling, narrow scope, human oversight exceptions |
| **6** | Does it have transparency obligations? | Check Article 50 categories |
| **7** | Document conclusion | Record reasoning and evidence |

## Scenario 1: HR Screening Tool

### The Situation

A multinational company deploys an AI system to screen incoming job applications. The system:
- Analyses CVs and cover letters
- Assigns scores to candidates based on predicted job fit
- Filters out candidates below a threshold score
- Ranks remaining candidates for human review

### Classification Analysis

**Step 1 - AI System?** Yes. Machine-based system processing inputs (CVs), generating outputs (scores/rankings) influencing hiring decisions.

**Step 2 - Prohibited?** No. Not subliminal manipulation, exploitation of vulnerabilities, social scoring, or other Article 5 categories.

**Step 3 - Annex III High-Risk?**

| Annex III Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Section 4(a): Recruitment/selection | **Yes - Explicit match** |
| "AI intended to be used for recruitment or selection" | Directly applies |
| "Filtering applications, evaluating candidates" | Matches exactly |

**Step 4 - Safety Component?** No. Not a product safety component.

**Step 5 - Article 6(3) Exception?**

| Exception Criterion | Analysis | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Intended for narrow procedural task? | No - substantive candidate evaluation | **Not applicable** |
| Intended to improve previous human assessment? | No - provides initial screening | **Not applicable** |
| Intended to detect decision patterns? | No - makes substantive recommendations | **Not applicable** |
| Human review always before action? | Partially - but AI filters out candidates | **Not sufficient** |

**Classification: HIGH-RISK (Annex III, Section 4(a))**

### Compliance Obligations

| Requirement | Article | Key Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Risk management | Article 9 | Assess bias, discrimination, accuracy risks |
| Data governance | Article 10 | Training data quality, representativeness |
| Technical documentation | Article 11 | Complete Annex IV file |
| Transparency | Article 13 | Instructions for HR teams |
| Human oversight | Article 14 | HR professional final decisions |
| Accuracy | Article 15 | Validate performance across demographics |
| Conformity assessment | Article 43 | Internal control (Annex VI) |
| Registration | Article 49 | EU database registration |

> ⚠️ **Red Flag:** If the system automatically rejects candidates without any human review, this could exacerbate compliance risks. Ensure meaningful human oversight for rejection decisions.

## Scenario 2: Customer Service Chatbot

### The Situation

An e-commerce company deploys an AI chatbot that:
- Answers customer questions about products
- Processes returns and complaints
- Escalates complex issues to human agents
- Uses a conversational interface

### Classification Analysis

**Step 1 - AI System?** Yes. Uses natural language processing to generate responses influencing customer interactions.

**Step 2 - Prohibited?** No. Not in any Article 5 category.

**Step 3 - Annex III High-Risk?**

| Annex III Category | Applies? |
| --- | --- |
| Section 1: Biometrics | No |
| Section 2: Critical infrastructure | No |
| Section 3: Education | No |
| Section 4: Employment | No |
| Section 5: Essential services | Not credit, not insurance, not benefits |
| Section 6: Law enforcement | No |
| Section 7: Migration/asylum | No |
| Section 8: Justice | No |

**Step 4 - Safety Component?** No.

**Step 5 - Limited Risk (Article 50)?**

| Article 50 Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 50(1): AI system designed for direct interaction? | **Yes** |
| Transparency obligation triggered? | **Yes** |

**Classification: LIMITED RISK (Article 50)**

### Compliance Obligations

| Requirement | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Transparency (Article 50(1))** | Clearly inform users they are interacting with an AI system |
| **Disclosure timing** | Before or at the beginning of interaction |
| **Exception** | Not required if obvious from context |

**Implementation Examples:**
- "Hi! I'm an AI assistant. How can I help you today?"
- Banner stating "You are chatting with our AI customer service bot"
- Clear indication in interface that this is automated assistance

> 💡 **Best Practice:** Even though not high-risk, document the chatbot's capabilities, limitations, and escalation procedures. This demonstrates responsible AI practices and aids future compliance assessments.

## Scenario 3: Emotion Recognition at Work

### The Situation

A manufacturing company proposes installing cameras with AI that:
- Monitors workers' facial expressions throughout their shift
- Infers emotional states (stress, fatigue, happiness)
- Alerts supervisors when workers appear stressed
- Stated purpose: "improving worker wellbeing"

### Classification Analysis

**Step 2 - Prohibited?**

| Article 5(1)(f) Check | Analysis |
| --- | --- |
| "AI systems that infer emotions" | Yes - inferring stress, fatigue, happiness |
| "Of a natural person" | Yes - workers |
| "In the workplace" | Yes - manufacturing facility |
| "Educational institution" | N/A |

**Exception Analysis:**

| Exception | Applies? |
| --- | --- |
| Medical reasons | No - "wellbeing" is not medical treatment |
| Safety reasons | Potentially - if fatigue monitoring prevents accidents |

**Classification: PROHIBITED (Article 5(1)(f))** — unless the company can demonstrate a genuine safety purpose.

### Critical Analysis

**If the company argues safety exception:**

| Criterion | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| Primary purpose safety? | Must be accident prevention, not productivity |
| Proportionality | Least intrusive means to achieve safety? |
| Worker consent | Informed consent present? |
| Alternative measures | Other safety measures considered? |

> ⚠️ **Warning:** "Improving wellbeing" is explicitly **not** a valid exception. The company would need to demonstrate:
> 1. Documented safety risks from worker fatigue
> 2. This system is necessary for safety (not just helpful)
> 3. Less intrusive alternatives are inadequate
> 4. The system is limited to genuine safety monitoring

**If Safety Exception Does Not Apply:**
- Deployment is prohibited
- No compliance pathway exists
- Penalties up to €35 million or 7% global turnover

## Scenario 4: Credit Scoring AI

### The Situation

A retail bank deploys an AI system that:
- Evaluates loan applications
- Analyses applicant data (income, employment, credit history)
- Generates creditworthiness scores
- Recommends approval, denial, or conditions

### Classification Analysis

**Step 3 - Annex III High-Risk?**

| Annex III Section 5(b) Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| "AI intended to be used to evaluate creditworthiness" | **Explicit match** |
| "Establish the credit score of natural persons" | **Explicit match** |
| "Exception: detecting financial fraud" | Does not apply - this is credit scoring |

**Classification: HIGH-RISK (Annex III, Section 5(b))**

### Enhanced Compliance Considerations

| Requirement | Specific Considerations for Credit Scoring |
| --- | --- |
| **Risk management** | Discrimination risks across protected characteristics |
| **Data governance** | Training data representativeness across demographics |
| **Transparency** | Clear explanation of factors influencing decisions |
| **Human oversight** | Human review for marginal cases, appeals process |
| **Accuracy** | Validate predictions across different applicant groups |
| **GDPR Article 22** | Right not to be subject to solely automated decisions |
| **Consumer credit law** | Sector-specific obligations may apply |

> 💡 **Expert Note:** Credit scoring AI faces heightened scrutiny for discrimination. Ensure robust fairness testing across age, gender, race, and other protected characteristics. Document all bias mitigation measures.

## Scenario 6: Predictive Policing System

### The Situation

A city police department considers deploying an AI system that:
- Analyses crime data and social factors
- Predicts areas likely to experience crime
- Recommends resource allocation
- Generates "risk scores" for neighbourhoods

### Classification Analysis

**Step 3 - Annex III High-Risk?**

| Annex III Section 6(d) Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| "AI intended to be used by law enforcement" | **Yes** |
| "Making individual risk assessments" | **Potentially** |
| "Assessing risk of criminal offence" | **If individual-level** |

**Additional Step 2 - Prohibited Check:**

| Article 5(1)(d) Check | Analysis |
| --- | --- |
| "Risk assessments of natural persons" | If predicting individual criminal behaviour |
| "To assess or predict risk of committing offence" | May be prohibited if individual-level |
| "Based solely on profiling or personality traits" | Key criterion |

## Scenario 7: Biometric Access Control

### The Situation

A secure facility deploys fingerprint scanners with AI that:
- Captures fingerprint images
- Compares against enrolled employee database
- Grants or denies access
- Logs all access attempts

### Classification Analysis

**Biometric Analysis:**

| Criterion | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| Biometric identification? | Yes - fingerprint |
| One-to-one verification? | Yes - comparing to enrolled template |
| One-to-many identification? | No - not searching database |
| Real-time? | Yes - instant verification |
| Publicly accessible space? | No - secure facility |

**Classification Framework:**

| System Type | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| Remote biometric identification (public spaces, real-time) | **Prohibited** (Article 5(1)(h)) unless exception |
| Remote biometric identification (post-facto) | High-Risk (Annex III, Section 1(a)) |
| Biometric verification (one-to-one) | **Limited Risk** (Article 50(3)) |

**Classification: LIMITED RISK (Article 50(3))**

The fingerprint verification system is one-to-one verification, not identification, and is therefore **not** prohibited or high-risk under the biometric categories.

### Compliance Obligations

| Requirement | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Transparency (Article 50(3))** | Inform persons subject to biometric system |
| **GDPR** | Explicit consent for biometric processing |
| **Documentation** | Best practice even if not mandatory |

## Classification Best Practices

1. **Document thoroughly** — Record your analysis, reasoning, and conclusion
2. **Consider context** — Same technology may have different classifications based on use
3. **Check prohibitions first** — Article 5 before Annex III
4. **Review exceptions** — Article 6(3) exceptions may apply
5. **Seek expert input** — Complex cases may benefit from legal review
6. **Monitor changes** — Classification may change with system modifications
7. **When uncertain, assume higher risk** — Conservative approach protects compliance

## Key Takeaways

- Classification is the foundational compliance activity—get it right first
- Follow a systematic approach: Prohibitions → Annex III → Sectoral legislation → Exceptions → Limited risk
- Context and intended purpose drive classification, not just technology
- The same AI technology can have different classifications based on deployment context
- Prohibited practices have no compliance pathway—they simply cannot be deployed
- Document all classification decisions with reasoning and evidence
- Review classifications when AI systems are modified or deployed in new contexts
