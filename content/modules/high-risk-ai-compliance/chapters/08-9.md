# Provider Obligations (Articles 16-22)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Identify all provider obligations under the AI Act
- Design and implement a compliant quality management system
- Establish effective post-market monitoring programmes
- Execute incident reporting and corrective action procedures
- Manage authorised representatives for non-EU providers

Providers of high-risk AI systems bear the most extensive obligations under the AI Act. This chapter provides a comprehensive guide to all provider responsibilities across the entire AI system lifecycle.

## Understanding Provider Role and Responsibility

### Who is a Provider?

**Article 3(3) Definition:** A provider is any natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that:
- **Develops** an AI system or a general-purpose AI model, OR
- **Has an AI system or GPAI model developed** for it, AND
- Places that system/model on the market or puts it into service under **its own name or trademark**, whether for payment or free of charge

### When Do You Become a Provider?

| Scenario | Provider Status | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Develop AI internally, deploy under own brand | **Provider** | Meet all criteria |
| Commission AI development, brand as your own | **Provider** | "Has developed" + own name |
| Substantially modify third-party AI | **May become Provider** | Article 25 modification rules |
| Deploy third-party AI without modification | **Deployer** (not provider) | Original provider responsible |
| White-label/rebrand third-party AI | **Provider** | Own name/trademark trigger |

> ⚠️ **Critical Distinction:** The provider role carries the heaviest compliance burden. Incorrectly classifying your role can result in non-compliance with fundamental obligations.
