# Data Governance (Article 10)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Implement comprehensive data governance for AI training, validation, and testing
- Apply Article 10 data quality requirements in practice
- Conduct systematic bias examination across protected characteristics
- Navigate the GDPR intersection for processing sensitive personal data
- Document data governance processes for compliance demonstration

---

Article 10 establishes **mandatory data governance practices** for high-risk AI systems. Since AI systems are fundamentally shaped by their training data, poor data governance leads to unreliable, biased, or unsafe AI. This article ensures data quality from collection through model deployment.

## Scope: What Data is Covered

Article 10 applies to **three categories of datasets**:

| Dataset Type | Purpose | Governance Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Training Data** | Model learning and development | Full Article 10 requirements |
| **Validation Data** | Model tuning and hyperparameter selection | Full Article 10 requirements |
| **Testing Data** | Performance evaluation and verification | Full Article 10 requirements |

> ⚠️ **Important:** Article 10 applies to AI systems that use machine learning techniques. For AI systems that don't use training data, the requirements apply to input data governance instead.

## The Data Governance Framework

### Article 10(2): Mandatory Governance Practices

You must implement governance practices covering:

| Requirement | What It Means | Practical Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **(a) Design choices** | Document why specific data was selected | Data selection criteria documentation |
| **(b) Collection processes** | Record how data was gathered and its origin | Data provenance tracking |
| **(c) Preparation operations** | Document annotation, labelling, cleaning | Data pipeline documentation |
| **(d) Assumptions** | State what the data is meant to measure | Data dictionary and metadata |
| **(e) Availability/suitability** | Assess if data is sufficient for purpose | Data adequacy assessment |
| **(f) Bias examination** | Check for discriminatory patterns | Bias audit processes |
| **(g) Gaps/shortcomings** | Identify what's missing or problematic | Data gap analysis |

## Data Quality Requirements

### Article 10(3): Quality Criteria

Datasets must meet these quality standards:

**Relevant**
- Data directly relates to the intended purpose
- Features are predictive of target outcomes
- Domain-appropriate data sources

**Sufficiently Representative**
- Covers the deployment population
- Includes edge cases and boundary conditions
- Geographic and demographic coverage

**Free of Errors (to the best extent possible)**
- Accurate labelling and annotation
- Correct data values
- Minimal measurement errors

**Complete (in view of intended purpose)**
- No critical missing data
- Sufficient sample sizes
- Temporal coverage as needed

### Data Quality Checklist

| Quality Dimension | Assessment Questions |
| --- | --- |
| **Accuracy** | Are labels correct? Are measurements precise? |
| **Completeness** | Is required data present? Are there gaps? |
| **Consistency** | Is data formatted uniformly? Are definitions stable? |
| **Timeliness** | Is data current? Does it reflect deployment conditions? |
| **Representativeness** | Does data reflect the deployment population? |
| **Relevance** | Does data relate to the intended purpose? |

## Bias Examination Requirements

### Article 10(2)(f): Mandatory Bias Assessment

You must examine datasets for biases "likely to affect health and safety of persons, have a negative impact on fundamental rights, or lead to discrimination."

### Types of Bias to Examine

| Bias Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Selection Bias** | Non-representative sampling | Recruiting AI trained only on tech workers |
| **Measurement Bias** | Inconsistent data collection | Different interview standards for groups |
| **Label Bias** | Discriminatory labelling patterns | Historical bias in performance ratings |
| **Representation Bias** | Under/over-representation of groups | Medical AI trained mostly on one gender |
| **Aggregation Bias** | Grouping hides disparities | One model for diverse populations |
| **Historical Bias** | Data reflects past discrimination | Credit data reflecting redlining |

### Protected Characteristics to Assess

Under EU non-discrimination law, examine bias across:
- Sex/Gender
- Racial or ethnic origin
- Religion or belief
- Disability
- Age
- Sexual orientation
- Nationality

### Bias Examination Process

**Step 1: Demographic Analysis**
- Analyse representation of protected groups
- Identify under/over-represented populations
- Document representation gaps

**Step 2: Label Distribution Analysis**
- Examine outcome labels across groups
- Identify historical discrimination patterns
- Assess label consistency across groups

**Step 3: Feature Analysis**
- Identify features correlated with protected characteristics
- Assess proxy discrimination risks
- Document feature selection rationale

**Step 4: Subgroup Performance**
- Test model performance across groups
- Identify disparate accuracy or error rates
- Document performance gaps

## Processing Sensitive Personal Data

### Article 10(5): Special Category Data Exception

Processing special category data (Article 9 GDPR) for bias monitoring is permitted **only when**:

**Conditions (all must be met):**
1. **Strictly necessary** for bias detection and correction
2. **Other data insufficient** to achieve the same purpose
3. **Appropriate safeguards** in place

**Required Safeguards:**
- Technical measures (pseudonymisation, access controls)
- Organisational measures (policies, training)
- Prohibition of processing for any other purpose
- Deletion after bias monitoring complete

| GDPR Article 9 Category | AI Act Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Racial/ethnic origin | May process for bias monitoring with safeguards |
| Political opinions | May process for bias monitoring with safeguards |
| Religious beliefs | May process for bias monitoring with safeguards |
| Health data | May process for bias monitoring with safeguards |
| Sex life/orientation | May process for bias monitoring with safeguards |
| Biometric data | May process for bias monitoring with safeguards |

> 💡 **Expert Insight:** The AI Act creates a specific legal basis for processing sensitive data to prevent AI discrimination. This is a significant departure from GDPR's otherwise restrictive approach to special category data. Document your justification carefully.

## Data Provenance and Lineage

### Tracking Data Origins

For each dataset, document:

| Element | Required Information |
| --- | --- |
| **Source** | Where data originated |
| **Collection method** | How data was gathered |
| **Collection date** | When data was collected |
| **Legal basis** | Lawful basis for collection |
| **Transformations** | How data was processed |
| **Chain of custody** | Who handled the data |

### Third-Party Data Considerations

When using external data:
- Verify provider's data governance practices
- Obtain representations about data quality
- Conduct independent quality assessment
- Document due diligence process

---

## Documentation Requirements

### Data Governance Documentation

Your technical documentation (Annex IV) must include:

| Document | Content |
| --- | --- |
| **Data Documentation** | Description of datasets, collection, preparation |
| **Bias Assessment Report** | Methods and findings of bias examination |
| **Data Quality Assessment** | Evidence of quality criteria compliance |
| **Sensitive Data Justification** | If applicable, justification for Article 10(5) |
| **Gap Analysis** | Identified shortcomings and mitigation |

---

## Integration with Other Requirements

| Requirement | Data Governance Connection |
| --- | --- |
| **Risk Management (Art. 9)** | Data risks feed into risk assessment |
| **Technical Documentation (Art. 11)** | Data governance is mandatory documentation content |
| **Accuracy (Art. 15)** | Data quality directly affects accuracy |
| **Post-Market Monitoring (Art. 72)** | Monitor for data drift and degradation |
