# Record-Keeping and Logging (Article 12)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Design AI logging systems that meet Article 12 requirements
- Determine appropriate log retention periods for different contexts
- Implement technical controls for log integrity and accessibility
- Establish logging procedures for different actor types
- Integrate logging with incident investigation and post-market monitoring

---

Article 12 mandates **automatic logging capabilities** for high-risk AI systems. Logs serve as the "flight recorder" for AI—enabling traceability, accountability, incident investigation, and regulatory oversight throughout the system's operational life.

## Why Logging Matters

### Traceability
Logs provide an audit trail of AI system operations, enabling reconstruction of what happened, when, and why.

### Accountability
When issues arise, logs identify who was involved and what decisions were made.

### Regulatory Compliance
Authorities use logs to investigate incidents and verify ongoing compliance.

### Continuous Improvement
Post-market monitoring relies on log data to identify performance issues.

## Article 12 Requirements

### Core Logging Obligation

High-risk AI systems shall **technically allow for automatic recording of events (logs)** over the lifetime of the system.

**Key elements:**
- **Automatic:** Logging must be built into the system, not manual
- **Events:** System activities and decisions must be captured
- **Lifetime:** From deployment through decommissioning

### Traceability Standard

Logging capabilities must ensure **traceability appropriate to the intended purpose**:

| Intended Purpose | Traceability Level | Example Logs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Medical diagnosis | High | All inputs, outputs, confidence scores, clinician interactions |
| Credit decisions | High | Application data, model outputs, human overrides |
| Recruitment screening | Medium-High | Candidate data processed, decisions, human review |
| Critical infrastructure | High | All operational decisions, alerts, interventions |

---

## What Must Be Logged

### Article 12(2) Specific Requirements

For biometric identification and categorisation systems, logs must specifically enable monitoring of:

| Log Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Period of use** | Start and end time of each use session |
| **Reference database** | Which database was used for matching |
| **Matching inputs** | Input data that resulted in matches |
| **Human verifiers** | Natural persons who verified results |

### General Logging Requirements

For all high-risk AI systems, capture:

| Category | Log Elements |
| --- | --- |
| **Inputs** | Data submitted to the system |
| **Outputs** | Decisions, predictions, recommendations made |
| **Confidence** | Certainty levels of outputs |
| **Context** | Environmental and operational conditions |
| **Users** | Who used the system and when |
| **Interventions** | Human overrides or modifications |
| **Errors** | System errors and anomalies |
| **Performance** | Accuracy and reliability metrics |

---

## Technical Implementation

### Logging Architecture

| Component | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| **Log Generation** | Automatic capture at system level |
| **Log Storage** | Secure, scalable, searchable storage |
| **Log Integrity** | Tamper-evident, immutable records |
| **Log Access** | Controlled access with audit trails |
| **Log Retention** | Configurable retention periods |

### Log Integrity Controls

| Control | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Append-only storage** | Prevent deletion or modification |
| **Cryptographic hashing** | Detect tampering |
| **Digital signatures** | Authenticate log entries |
| **Secure timestamps** | Establish reliable chronology |
| **Access logging** | Track who accessed logs |

> 💡 **Expert Insight:** Consider blockchain-based or immutable database solutions for high-stakes AI systems. These provide cryptographic proof of log integrity that can withstand regulatory scrutiny.

### Log Format Standards

Structure logs for machine readability and human analysis:

**Recommended elements per log entry:**
- Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
- Event type
- System component
- User identifier (where applicable)
- Input summary/hash
- Output details
- Confidence score
- Decision rationale (if available)
- Session identifier

## Retention Requirements

### Retention Period Determination

Article 12 requires **appropriate retention** based on context:

| Context | Minimum Retention | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Medical/health decisions** | Duration of clinical relevance + legal retention | Patient safety, medical records law |
| **Employment decisions** | Duration of employment + limitation period | Employment tribunal claims |
| **Credit/financial** | Duration of relationship + regulatory period | Financial services requirements |
| **Law enforcement** | Per national requirements | Criminal justice needs |
| **Critical infrastructure** | Operational lifetime + investigation period | Safety investigations |

### Deployer Retention Obligations

Article 26(5) specifically requires deployers to:
- Keep logs generated automatically (while under their control)
- Retain for period **appropriate to the intended purpose**
- Retain for **at least 6 months** unless otherwise provided

### Provider Retention Obligations

Providers must retain logs:
- While AI system is under their control
- For technical documentation purposes (10 years)
- For post-market monitoring purposes

## Access and Availability

### Who Can Access Logs

| Actor | Access Right | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Provider** | Full access | Development, monitoring, compliance |
| **Deployer** | Operational access | Use monitoring, incident response |
| **Market surveillance authorities** | On request | Enforcement, investigations |
| **Notified bodies** | During assessment | Conformity verification |
| **Affected individuals** | Subject access rights | GDPR/fundamental rights |

### Facilitating Regulatory Access

Implement mechanisms for:
- Rapid log retrieval upon authority request
- Log export in standard formats
- Secure transmission to authorities
- Query and filtering capabilities

## Integration with Other Requirements

| Requirement | Logging Connection |
| --- | --- |
| **Risk Management (Art. 9)** | Logs feed continuous risk monitoring |
| **Technical Documentation (Art. 11)** | Logging capabilities documented |
| **Human Oversight (Art. 14)** | Log human interventions and overrides |
| **Post-Market Monitoring (Art. 72)** | Logs are primary monitoring data source |
| **Incident Reporting (Art. 73)** | Logs support incident investigation |
