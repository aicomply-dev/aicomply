# Conformity Assessment (Article 43)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Select the appropriate conformity assessment route for different AI system types
- Execute internal control procedures per Annex VI requirements
- Understand when third-party (notified body) assessment is required
- Prepare complete EU declarations of conformity
- Navigate substantial modification requirements
- Apply CE marking correctly

---

Article 43 establishes the conformity assessment procedures that providers must complete before placing high-risk AI systems on the Union market or putting them into service. This gatekeeping mechanism ensures AI systems demonstrably meet all applicable requirements.

## The Conformity Assessment Framework

### Purpose and Legal Basis

**Article 43(1)** requires providers to follow conformity assessment procedures specified in the regulation before market placement. The choice of procedure depends on:

1. Whether the AI system falls under Annex III (standalone classification) or Annex I (sectoral legislation)
2. The specific category of high-risk AI system
3. Whether harmonised standards have been applied

> 💡 **Expert Insight:** The conformity assessment is the provider's formal demonstration that they have met all Chapter III, Section 2 requirements. It's the checkpoint between development and market access.

## Internal Control Procedure (Annex VI)

### When Internal Control Applies

Most high-risk AI systems in Annex III can use internal control procedures. This is a **self-assessment** by the provider—no third-party involvement required.

### Annex VI Step-by-Step Process

| Step | Action | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | Verify QMS compliance | QMS assessment records |
| **2** | Examine technical documentation | Technical file verification checklist |
| **3** | Verify all Chapter III, Section 2 requirements met | Compliance matrix |
| **4** | Draw up EU declaration of conformity | Signed declaration document |
| **5** | Affix CE marking | CE marking placement record |
| **6** | Register in EU database | Registration confirmation |

### Technical Documentation Examination

The provider must verify their technical documentation (per Annex IV) demonstrates:

| Requirement | Documentation Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Risk management (Art. 9) | Risk assessment reports, mitigation records |
| Data governance (Art. 10) | Data specifications, quality reports |
| Technical documentation (Art. 11) | Complete Annex IV file |
| Record-keeping (Art. 12) | Logging specifications, retention policy |
| Transparency (Art. 13) | Instructions for use, labelling |
| Human oversight (Art. 14) | Oversight procedures, interface design |
| Accuracy, robustness, security (Art. 15) | Test reports, validation results |

### Quality Management System Review

Before issuing a declaration, verify the QMS (Article 17) addresses:

- [ ] Regulatory compliance strategy
- [ ] Design and development procedures
- [ ] Quality control techniques
- [ ] Examination, test, and validation procedures
- [ ] Technical specifications and standards
- [ ] Data management systems
- [ ] Risk management implementation
- [ ] Post-market monitoring system
- [ ] Incident reporting procedures
- [ ] Resource management

> ⚠️ **Compliance Critical:** Internal control is not a rubber stamp. The provider takes full legal responsibility for the accuracy of their self-assessment. Inadequate internal control processes are a common enforcement target.

## Third-Party Assessment (Annex VII)

### When Notified Body Assessment Is Required

**Article 43(2)** mandates third-party assessment for:

- Remote biometric identification systems used in real-time
- Remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces
- Any system where Union harmonisation legislation requires third-party assessment

### The Notified Body Process

| Phase | Activities | Typical Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Application** | Submit technical documentation, identify system | 2-4 weeks |
| **2. Documentation Review** | Notified body examines Annex IV file | 4-8 weeks |
| **3. Assessment Planning** | Determine audit scope and testing requirements | 2 weeks |
| **4. On-Site Audit** | Quality management system assessment | 1-2 weeks |
| **5. Technical Testing** | Verify accuracy, robustness, security claims | 2-6 weeks |
| **6. Report & Decision** | Notified body issues assessment report | 2-4 weeks |
| **7. Certificate Issuance** | If successful, conformity certificate issued | 1-2 weeks |

### Notified Body Requirements

Notified bodies must be:

| Requirement | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Designated** | By Member State national authority | Article 28 |
| **Competent** | Technical expertise in AI systems assessed | Article 31 |
| **Independent** | No conflicts of interest with assessed providers | Article 31 |
| **Accredited** | Meet ISO/IEC 17065 or equivalent | Article 31 |
| **Notified** | Listed in NANDO database | Article 30 |

### Third-Party Assessment Outcomes

| Outcome | Result | Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Positive** | Conformity certificate issued | Affix CE marking, register, market |
| **Conditional** | Certificate with conditions | Address conditions, resubmit evidence |
| **Negative** | Assessment failed | Remediate issues, request reassessment |
| **Suspended** | Existing certificate suspended | Address findings, request reinstatement |
| **Withdrawn** | Certificate cancelled | Cannot place on market until new assessment |

## EU Declaration of Conformity (Article 47)

### Required Content (Annex V)

The declaration must contain:

| Element | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **System identification** | Name, type, unique product ID | "AI Recruit Pro v3.2, Type HR-100, ID: AIR-2024-001" |
| **Provider details** | Name, address, contact | Full legal entity details |
| **Responsibility statement** | Provider assumes responsibility | Standard Article 47 wording |
| **Compliance statement** | Declares compliance with AI Act | Reference to specific articles |
| **Harmonised standards** | Standards applied (if any) | EN ISO XXXX:2025 |
| **Common specifications** | Specs applied (if no standards) | Commission implementing acts |
| **Notified body** | If third-party assessment | Name, ID number, certificate reference |
| **Date and signature** | Legal representative signature | Dated, authorised signatory |

### Declaration Template Structure

```
EU DECLARATION OF CONFORMITY
(Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)

1. AI System: [Name, type, version, unique identifier]

2. Provider: [Legal name, registered address, contact]

   [Signature]
```

## CE Marking Requirements

### Affixing the CE Marking

**Article 48** requirements:

| Requirement | Specification |
| --- | --- |
| **Visibility** | Clearly visible |
| **Legibility** | Easily readable |
| **Permanence** | Indelibly affixed |
| **Location** | On AI system or packaging/accompanying document |
| **Size** | Minimum 5mm height (proportionally scaled) |
| **Format** | Standard CE logo per Annex |

### CE Marking for Digital AI Systems

For AI systems without physical components:

- Include in user interface
- Display in documentation
- Show in digital labelling/metadata
- Reference in instructions for use

> 💡 **Practical Note:** Many AI systems are purely software. The CE marking appears in the product documentation, interface, and packaging (if any physical media exists).

## Substantial Modifications (Article 43(4))

### Definition of Substantial Modification

A modification is "substantial" if it affects compliance with:

- Any Chapter III, Section 2 requirement
- The intended purpose as originally assessed
- The risk classification of the system

### Modification Assessment Framework

| Modification Type | Examples | Reassessment Required? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Performance improvement** | Model retraining on similar data | Likely no—document change |
| **New functionality** | Additional use cases | Yes—may change risk profile |
| **Architecture change** | New model architecture | Yes—reassess Article 15 |
| **Training data change** | Different data sources/demographics | Yes—reassess Article 10 |
| **Intended purpose change** | New deployment context | Yes—full reassessment |
| **Bug fixes** | Error corrections | Usually no—document only |

### Post-Modification Process

If substantial modification occurs:

1. **Assess Impact** — Determine which requirements affected
2. **Update Documentation** — Revise technical documentation
3. **Re-verify Compliance** — Conduct new conformity assessment
4. **Update Declaration** — Issue new EU declaration
5. **Update Registration** — Notify EU database of changes
6. **Inform Deployers** — Communicate changes to users

> ⚠️ **Important:** Continuous learning AI systems may trigger substantial modification obligations through operational changes. Design monitoring processes to detect when retraining crosses the substantial modification threshold.

## Integration with Sectoral Legislation

### Annex I, Section A Systems

For AI systems covered by EU legislation listed in Annex I, Section A:

- Follow that legislation's conformity assessment procedure
- Additionally verify AI Act Chapter III, Section 2 requirements
- Single assessment may cover both frameworks

### Annex I, Section B Systems (Products)

For AI embedded in products (e.g., machinery, medical devices):

- AI assessment integrates with product conformity assessment
- Notified body for product may assess AI requirements
- Single declaration covers both product and AI compliance
