# Transparency and Information (Article 13)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Design AI systems with appropriate transparency for deployer interpretation
- Create comprehensive instructions for use meeting Article 13 requirements
- Communicate AI capabilities, limitations, and risks effectively
- Calibrate transparency level to intended purpose and user competence
- Integrate transparency with human oversight requirements

Article 13 establishes the **transparency foundation** for trustworthy AI. High-risk AI systems must be designed so deployers can **understand, interpret, and appropriately use** the system's outputs. Without transparency, human oversight becomes impossible.

## The Transparency Imperative

### Why Transparency Matters

| Purpose | Benefit |
| --- | --- |
| **Interpretability** | Deployers understand what AI outputs mean |
| **Appropriate use** | Deployers use AI within intended parameters |
| **Risk awareness** | Deployers know limitations and failure modes |
| **Human oversight** | Enables meaningful human control |
| **Accountability** | Clear understanding of AI behaviour |

---

## Article 13 Requirements

### Core Transparency Standard

High-risk AI systems must be designed and developed to ensure operation is **sufficiently transparent** to enable deployers to:

1. **Interpret the system's output** appropriately
2. **Use it appropriately** for its intended purpose

### Transparency Calibration

The level of transparency must be appropriate to:

| Factor | Consideration |
| --- | --- |
| **Intended purpose** | Higher stakes = more transparency needed |
| **User competence** | Technical vs. non-technical users |
| **State of the art** | What transparency is technically feasible |
| **Deployment context** | Operational environment constraints |

---

## Instructions for Use (Article 13(3))

### Mandatory Content

Providers must supply deployers with instructions including:

| Element | Required Information |
| --- | --- |
| **Provider identity** | Name, address, contact details |
| **Authorised representative** | If applicable, representative details |
| **System identification** | Characteristics enabling identification |
| **Intended purpose** | What the system is designed to do |
| **Performance** | Accuracy, robustness levels and metrics |
| **Limitations** | Known limitations and performance boundaries |
| **Foreseeable misuse** | Uses that should be avoided |
| **Risk circumstances** | Situations that may lead to risks |
| **Human oversight** | Technical capabilities and measures |
| **Input specifications** | Required format, quality, constraints |
| **Interpretability tools** | How to understand outputs |
| **Changes made** | Modifications since initial market placement |

### Writing Effective Instructions

**Best Practices:**

| Principle | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Audience-appropriate** | Match user technical level |
| **Actionable** | Tell users what to DO |
| **Complete** | Cover all required elements |
| **Clear** | Avoid jargon where possible |
| **Accessible** | Easy to find and navigate |
| **Updated** | Reflect current system state |

### Common Instruction Failures

| Failure | Problem |
| --- | --- |
| Generic templates | Don't reflect specific system |
| Missing limitations | Deployer doesn't know boundaries |
| Unclear metrics | Performance claims not verifiable |
| Buried warnings | Risk information not prominent |
| Outdated content | Doesn't match current system |

---

## Communicating AI Capabilities and Limitations

### Performance Disclosure

| Metric Type | How to Communicate |
| --- | --- |
| **Accuracy** | "System achieves X% accuracy on [specific task]" |
| **Precision/Recall** | "X% of positive predictions correct; Y% of actual positives detected" |
| **Error rates** | "False positive rate: X%; False negative rate: Y%" |
| **Confidence ranges** | "Outputs include confidence scores from 0-100%" |

### Limitation Disclosure

Clearly communicate:
- **Input limitations:** What data types/quality the system can process
- **Population limitations:** Groups where performance may differ
- **Environmental limitations:** Conditions affecting performance
- **Temporal limitations:** When data currency affects outputs
- **Failure modes:** How the system fails and warning signs

### Risk Communication

| Risk Type | Disclosure Approach |
| --- | --- |
| **Safety risks** | Prominent warnings with specific scenarios |
| **Fundamental rights risks** | Clear statement of potential impacts |
| **Bias risks** | Groups that may be disproportionately affected |
| **Misuse risks** | Explicit "do not use for" statements |

> 💡 **Expert Insight:** Think of instructions like medical package inserts—comprehensive information for professional users who need to understand benefits, risks, contraindications, and proper use.

## Transparency for Different User Types

### Technical Users

Provide:
- Detailed performance metrics
- Model architecture information
- Training data characteristics
- Validation methodology
- API specifications

### Business Users

Provide:
- Plain-language capability descriptions
- Use case guidance
- Decision support information
- Escalation procedures
- Limitation summaries

### Affected Persons

For those subject to AI decisions:
- Notice of AI involvement (Article 50)
- Explanation of decision factors
- Challenge/appeal procedures
- Human contact options

---

## Transparency Technologies

### Explainability Methods

| Method | Application |
| --- | --- |
| **Feature importance** | Which inputs influenced output |
| **Counterfactual explanations** | "If X had been Y, outcome would change" |
| **Local explanations** | Why this specific decision was made |
| **Model cards** | Standardised system documentation |
| **Datasheets** | Training data documentation |

### User Interface Considerations

| Element | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Confidence displays** | Show certainty of outputs |
| **Explanation interfaces** | Provide decision reasoning |
| **Warning indicators** | Flag low-confidence or edge cases |
| **Override options** | Enable human intervention |

---

## Integration with Other Requirements

| Requirement | Transparency Connection |
| --- | --- |
| **Human Oversight (Art. 14)** | Transparency enables oversight |
| **Technical Documentation (Art. 11)** | Instructions are documentation component |
| **Accuracy (Art. 15)** | Accuracy must be transparently declared |
| **Article 50** | Notification obligations for affected persons |
