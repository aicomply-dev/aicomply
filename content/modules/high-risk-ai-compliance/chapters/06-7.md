Article 15 establishes the technical performance requirements that ensure high-risk AI systems operate reliably, safely, and securely throughout their lifecycle. These requirements form the technical foundation of AI Act compliance.

## Understanding Article 15 Requirements

**Article 15(1)** states: *"High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way that they achieve an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity, and that they perform consistently in those respects throughout their lifecycle."*

This creates a **continuous obligation**—performance must be maintained throughout the AI system's operational life, not just at the point of market placement.

## Accuracy Requirements in Detail

### What is "Appropriate Accuracy"?

The AI Act deliberately avoids prescribing specific accuracy thresholds because appropriate levels depend on:

| Factor | Consideration |
| --- | --- |
| **Intended Purpose** | A diagnostic AI requires different accuracy than a recommendation system |
| **Affected Persons** | Higher accuracy for systems affecting fundamental rights |
| **Risk Severity** | Life-critical applications demand higher performance |
| **State of the Art** | Comparison with technically achievable standards |
| **Reasonably Foreseeable Use** | Including potential misuse scenarios |

### Required Accuracy Disclosures (Article 15(2))

Providers must declare in instructions for use:

| Disclosure Element | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Accuracy Level** | Overall performance metric | "95% precision on test dataset" |
| **Accuracy Metrics** | Specific measures used | Precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC |
| **Conditions** | Operating conditions for stated accuracy | "Under standard lighting conditions" |
| **Target Groups** | Any performance variations by demographic | "Accuracy may vary across age groups" |
| **Known Limitations** | Scenarios where accuracy degrades | "Reduced accuracy in low-light environments" |

> ⚠️ **Compliance Critical:** Many AI systems show significant accuracy disparities across demographic groups. Article 15 implicitly requires disclosure of known disparities and their implications for affected persons.

### Accuracy Metrics by AI System Type

| AI Application | Primary Metrics | Secondary Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Classification** (e.g., hiring screening) | Precision, Recall, F1-Score | False Positive Rate, False Negative Rate |
| **Biometric Identification** | True Accept Rate, False Accept Rate | False Reject Rate at threshold |
| **Prediction** (e.g., credit scoring) | AUC-ROC, Calibration | Brier Score, Log Loss |
| **Detection** | Mean Average Precision | Intersection over Union |
| **Regression** | Mean Absolute Error, RMSE | R-squared, Prediction Intervals |

## Robustness Requirements (Article 15(3)-(4))

### The Robustness Mandate

**Article 15(3):** AI systems must be resilient to errors, faults, or inconsistencies that may occur within the system or its operating environment, particularly due to interaction with natural persons or other systems.

**Article 15(4):** Technical redundancy solutions—including backup or fail-safe plans—may be appropriate.

### Types of Robustness

| Robustness Type | Description | Implementation Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Input Robustness** | Handles unexpected or noisy inputs | Input validation, data preprocessing, anomaly detection |
| **Distributional Robustness** | Performs on data differing from training distribution | Domain adaptation, robust optimisation |
| **Adversarial Robustness** | Resists deliberately manipulated inputs | Adversarial training, certified defences |
| **Operational Robustness** | Functions despite system changes | Version control, model versioning, A/B testing |
| **Environmental Robustness** | Adapts to operational environment changes | Sensor fusion, environmental monitoring |

### Designing Fail-Safe Mechanisms

**Fail-Safe Hierarchy for High-Risk AI:**

1. **Graceful Degradation** — Reduced functionality rather than complete failure
2. **Safe State Fallback** — Return to known-safe operating state
3. **Human Handover** — Transfer control to human operator
4. **Emergency Shutdown** — Cease operation entirely
5. **Alert Generation** — Notify relevant parties of failure

**Fail-Safe Implementation Checklist:**

- [ ] Define safe states for all operating modes
- [ ] Implement continuous self-monitoring
- [ ] Create automatic fallback triggers
- [ ] Design manual override capabilities
- [ ] Test fail-safe activation under realistic conditions
- [ ] Document fail-safe procedures in instructions for use

> 💡 **Expert Insight:** The best fail-safe systems assume failure is inevitable and design for graceful degradation. Article 15(4) explicitly contemplates "backup or fail-safe plans" as appropriate technical solutions.

## Cybersecurity Requirements (Article 15(5))

### AI-Specific Attack Vectors

**Article 15(5)** specifically identifies threats unique to AI systems:

| Attack Type | Description | Mitigation Strategies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Poisoning** | Corrupting training data to embed malicious behaviour | Data provenance tracking, anomaly detection, clean data validation |
| **Model Poisoning** | Directly manipulating model parameters | Secure model storage, integrity verification, access controls |
| **Adversarial Examples** | Crafted inputs causing misclassification | Adversarial training, input preprocessing, ensemble defences |
| **Model Evasion** | Inputs designed to bypass detection | Robust feature extraction, multiple detection methods |
| **Confidentiality Attacks** | Extracting training data or model details | Differential privacy, membership inference defences |
| **Model Inversion** | Reconstructing sensitive training data | Output perturbation, query limiting |
| **Model Extraction** | Stealing model architecture/weights | Query monitoring, watermarking, rate limiting |

### Cybersecurity Assessment Framework

**Pre-Deployment Security Testing:**

| Test Type | Purpose | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vulnerability Assessment** | Identify known vulnerabilities | Before deployment, after major updates |
| **Penetration Testing** | Simulate real-world attacks | Quarterly or after significant changes |
| **Adversarial Testing** | Test AI-specific attack resistance | Before deployment, continuous monitoring |
| **Red Team Exercises** | Comprehensive attack simulation | Annually for critical systems |
| **Security Audit** | Review security controls and processes | Annually, or as required |

### Integration with Cyber Resilience Act

The AI Act's cybersecurity requirements align with the **Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)**. For AI systems with digital elements:

- CRA establishes baseline cybersecurity requirements for products
- AI Act adds AI-specific threat coverage
- Harmonised standards will provide implementation details
- Conformity with CRA cybersecurity requirements contributes to AI Act compliance

> ⚠️ **Important:** Article 15(5) requires resilience against threats "throughout the lifecycle"—security is not a one-time assessment but an ongoing obligation.

## Performance Testing and Validation

### Continuous Performance Monitoring Framework

| Monitoring Aspect | Metrics to Track | Alert Thresholds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Accuracy Drift** | Deviation from baseline performance | >5% degradation triggers review |
| **Data Drift** | Input distribution changes | Statistical significance tests |
| **Concept Drift** | Relationship changes between inputs and outputs | Performance on holdout sets |
| **Prediction Stability** | Consistency across similar inputs | Variance monitoring |
| **Response Time** | Latency and throughput | Service level agreement breaches |

### Testing Protocol

**Recommended Testing Cadence:**

| Test | Frequency | Documentation Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Performance validation | Monthly minimum | Test results, datasets used |
| Robustness testing | Quarterly | Test scenarios, failure modes |
| Security assessment | Quarterly | Vulnerability scan results |
| Full adversarial evaluation | Semi-annually | Attack scenarios, defences tested |
| Third-party audit | Annually | Audit report, remediation plan |

## Documentation Requirements for Article 15

Technical documentation must include:

| Document Element | Content | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Accuracy Specification** | Metrics, levels, validation methodology | Annex IV, Section 2(g) |
| **Robustness Analysis** | Failure modes, mitigations, test results | Annex IV, Section 2(h) |
| **Cybersecurity Assessment** | Threat analysis, controls, test results | Annex IV, Section 2(i) |
| **Validation Records** | Test data, procedures, results | Annex IV, Section 3 |
