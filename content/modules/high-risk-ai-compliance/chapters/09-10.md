Deployers of high-risk AI systems have specific obligations under Article 26. While less extensive than provider obligations, these requirements are essential for ensuring high-risk AI is used safely, ethically, and in compliance with fundamental rights.

## Understanding the Deployer Role

### Who is a Deployer?

**Article 3(4) Definition:** A deployer is any natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body using an AI system under its authority, **except where the AI system is used in the course of a personal non-professional activity**.

### Provider vs. Deployer Distinction

| Criterion | Provider | Deployer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core activity** | Develops/places on market | Uses under own authority |
| **Compliance burden** | Extensive (Articles 8-22) | Focused (Article 26) |
| **Pre-market obligations** | Yes | No |
| **Post-market obligations** | Yes | Limited |
| **Typical examples** | AI vendors, software companies | Enterprises, public authorities |

### When Deployers Become Providers

**Article 25** triggers provider status when a deployer:

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Places their name/trademark on high-risk AI | Becomes provider for that system |
| Makes substantial modification | Becomes provider for modified system |
| Changes intended purpose to high-risk | Becomes provider for new purpose |

> ⚠️ **Critical Warning:** Modifications to AI systems—even seemingly minor changes—may trigger provider obligations. Always assess modifications against Article 25 criteria before implementation.

## Core Deployer Obligations (Article 26(1)-(7))

### The Complete Obligation Framework

- [ ] Escalation procedures followed
- [ ] Regular performance reviews

## Input Data Quality (Article 26(4))

### Ensuring Input Data Relevance

Deployers must ensure input data is **relevant and sufficiently representative** in view of the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system.

| Data Quality Dimension | Deployer Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **Relevance** | Input data matches the system's intended use case |
| **Representativeness** | Data reflects the population/scenarios where AI is applied |
| **Completeness** | Required data fields are populated |
| **Accuracy** | Data is correct and current |
| **Timeliness** | Data is sufficiently recent for the use case |

### Data Quality Monitoring

Implement ongoing data quality checks:

- [ ] Define data quality criteria aligned with instructions for use
- [ ] Establish data validation at point of entry
- [ ] Monitor for data drift or distribution changes
- [ ] Report data quality issues to provider if affecting system performance
- [ ] Document data quality assessments and actions taken

## Operation Monitoring (Article 26(5))

### Monitoring Requirements

Deployers must monitor high-risk AI operation on the basis of the instructions for use and, where relevant, inform providers in accordance with Article 72(1).

**Monitoring Framework:**

| Monitoring Aspect | Frequency | Action Triggers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Performance accuracy** | Continuous/periodic | Deviation beyond threshold |
| **Output quality** | Per use | Anomalous outputs |
| **User feedback** | Ongoing | Complaints or concerns |
| **Incident detection** | Continuous | Any malfunction or harm |
| **Compliance status** | Periodic | Audit findings |

### Incident Reporting to Providers

When monitoring reveals issues, deployers must inform providers if:

- Performance degrades significantly
- Unexpected outputs or behaviours occur
- Users report problems or concerns
- Incidents cause or risk harm

## Log Retention (Article 26(6))

### Minimum Retention Requirements

| Log Type | Minimum Period | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Automatically generated logs** | 6 months minimum | Or longer if required by other law |
| **Appropriate to intended purpose** | As specified | Provider may specify longer periods |
| **Under deployer control** | Throughout | Deployer responsible for retention |

### Log Management Best Practices

- [ ] Establish log retention policy aligned with AI Act and other regulations
- [ ] Implement secure, tamper-evident log storage
- [ ] Create log retrieval procedures for authority requests
- [ ] Document log contents and format
- [ ] Plan for log handover if AI system is transferred
- [ ] Consider longer retention where fundamental rights implicated

> ⚠️ **Important:** GDPR may require data minimisation while AI Act requires log retention. Resolve this tension by ensuring logs contain minimum necessary personal data and implementing appropriate access controls.

## Worker Information Requirements (Article 26(7))

### Mandatory Information Provision

**Before** putting a high-risk AI system into use at the workplace, deployers must inform:

- Workers
- Worker representatives (if any)

### Information Content

| Information Element | Detail Required |
| --- | --- |
| **AI system deployment** | What AI system, when deployed |
| **Intended purpose** | How AI will be used in workplace |
| **Impact on workers** | How workers may be affected |
| **Decision scope** | What decisions AI will inform/make |
| **Human oversight** | Who oversees AI, how to raise concerns |
| **Rights** | Workers' rights regarding AI decisions |

### Works Council and Union Consultation

Where applicable, integrate AI deployment into existing consultation frameworks:

- Inform works councils in advance of deployment
- Consult on impact assessments
- Address concerns raised by worker representatives
- Update collective agreements if needed

## Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (Article 27)

### When FRIA is Required

**Article 27** mandates FRIA for deployers that are:

| Deployer Type | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Bodies governed by public law** | Mandatory FRIA |
| **Private entities providing public services** | Mandatory FRIA |
| **Credit institutions (credit scoring)** | Mandatory FRIA |
