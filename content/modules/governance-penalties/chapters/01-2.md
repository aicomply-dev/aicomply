## Authority Framework Overview

The AI Act requires each Member State to designate national authorities responsible for enforcement. This creates a decentralised enforcement landscape where understanding local authority structures is essential for compliance.

### Authority Types Required

| Authority Type | Legal Basis | Primary Role | Key Activities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Notifying Authority** | Article 28 | Conformity assessment body oversight | Designate, monitor, and supervise notified bodies |
| **Market Surveillance Authority** | Article 74 | AI system monitoring | Inspect, investigate, enforce compliance |
| **Competent Authority** | Article 70 | General AI Act enforcement | Coordination, guidance, penalty imposition |

### Designation Requirements

| Requirement | Article | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **At least one authority** | Article 70(1) | Minimum requirement per Member State |
| **Adequate resources** | Article 70(2) | Human, technical, and financial resources |
| **Independence** | Article 70(3) | Functional independence from external influence |
| **Expertise** | Article 70(3) | Competence in AI, fundamental rights, data protection |
| **Notification to Commission** | Article 70(5) | Inform Commission of designated authorities |

## Authority Powers (Article 74-77)

### Information Access Powers

| Power | Scope | Legal Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Document Requests** | Technical documentation, conformity records, logs | Article 74(3)(a) |
| **AI System Access** | Access to AI systems, including source code where necessary | Article 74(3)(b) |
| **Data Access** | Training, validation, and test datasets | Article 74(3)(c) |
| **Algorithm Access** | Access to algorithms and processes | Article 74(3)(d) |
| **Premises Access** | Physical access to premises, data centres | Article 74(3)(e) |
| **Personnel Interviews** | Question relevant personnel | Article 74(3)(f) |

### Investigation Powers

| Power | Description | Conditions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **On-site Inspections** | Unannounced or scheduled inspections | Proportionate to risk |
| **Sample Collection** | Obtain AI system samples for testing | Testing purposes |
| **Expert Engagement** | Engage external technical experts | Complex evaluations |
| **Joint Investigations** | Cross-border coordinated investigations | Multi-Member State issues |
| **Third-Party Inquiries** | Request information from value chain participants | Supply chain tracing |

### Enforcement Powers

| Power | Article | Application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Corrective Measures** | Article 79(1) | Order modifications to achieve compliance |
| **Market Withdrawal** | Article 79(2)(a) | Order removal from EU market |
| **Product Recall** | Article 79(2)(b) | Recall from deployers and end users |
| **Prohibition** | Article 79(2)(c) | Prohibit making AI system available |
| **Warnings** | Article 79(1)(a) | Formal warning to operator |
| **Administrative Fines** | Article 99 | Financial penalties (see Chapter 3) |

> **Expert Insight:** Authorities increasingly use a "soft power" approach before formal enforcement—engaging in dialogue, issuing guidance, and allowing correction periods. However, don't mistake this for lenience; serious violations or non-cooperation will trigger full enforcement powers.

## Authority Models Across Member States

## Preparing for Authority Engagement

### Inspection Readiness Checklist

| Category | Preparation | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Documentation** | All technical documentation current and accessible | Organised file system |
| **Access Protocols** | Procedures for providing system access | Access credentials, NDAs |
| **Personnel** | Designated compliance contacts identified | Contact list, availability |
| **Premises** | Visitor protocols, secure areas identified | Access procedures |
| **Response Team** | Cross-functional team ready to respond | Escalation procedures |
| **Legal Support** | Legal counsel available for complex requests | External counsel on retainer |
