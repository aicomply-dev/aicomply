## Fine Calculation Framework (Article 99(6))

Article 99(6) mandates that authorities consider specific factors when determining the actual penalty amount within maximum limits. This creates a structured but discretionary framework.

### Mandatory Consideration Factors

| Factor Category | Specific Elements | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Nature of violation** | Type of obligation breached, fundamental or technical | High |
| **Gravity** | Seriousness, scale, systemic nature | High |
| **Duration** | How long violation continued | Medium-High |
| **Intentionality** | Deliberate vs. negligent | High |
| **Mitigation actions** | Corrective steps taken | Medium-High |
| **Prior violations** | History of non-compliance | High |
| **Harm caused** | Actual impact on persons | High |
| **Cooperation** | Engagement with authorities | Medium |

---

## Factor 1: Nature, Gravity, and Duration

### Nature of Violation

| Violation Type | Severity Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| **Prohibited practice** | Inherently severe—fundamental breach |
| **Core safety requirement** | Severe—risk to persons |
| **Documentation gap** | Moderate—depends on materiality |
| **Technical non-compliance** | Lower—if correctable |
| **Transparency failure** | Varies—depends on context |

### Gravity Assessment

| Gravity Indicator | Low | Medium | High |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Single instance | Multiple instances | Systematic |
| **Impact** | Minimal | Moderate harm | Significant harm |
| **Affected persons** | Few | Many | Vulnerable groups |
| **Detection** | Self-identified | Random surveillance | Complaint/incident |
| **Remediation** | Easy | Requires effort | Structural change |

### Duration Considerations

| Duration | Assessment | Multiplier Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Brief (< 1 month)** | Lower severity | Minimal |
| **Short (1-6 months)** | Moderate | Some |
| **Medium (6-12 months)** | Significant | Substantial |
| **Long (> 12 months)** | Severe | Major |
| **Continuing** | Most severe | Ongoing |

> **Expert Insight:** Duration is calculated from when the violation began, not when detected. If you discover historical non-compliance, immediate remediation limits duration exposure.

## Factor 2: Intentionality and Fault

### Intentionality Spectrum

| Level | Description | Penalty Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Deliberate** | Knowing violation of requirements | Highest—near maximum |
| **Reckless** | Disregard for obvious compliance needs | High |
| **Grossly negligent** | Serious failure in reasonable care | Medium-High |
| **Negligent** | Failure to exercise due care | Medium |
| **No fault** | Despite reasonable efforts | Low—may avoid penalty |

### Evidence of Intentionality

| Indicator | Suggests Intentional | Suggests Negligent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Internal communications** | Awareness of non-compliance | Confusion, uncertainty |
| **Compliance programme** | Absent or ignored | Present but inadequate |
| **Expert advice** | Contrary advice ignored | Followed advice that was wrong |
| **Industry practice** | Deviated from norms | Followed industry norms |
| **Response to warnings** | Ignored | Attempted compliance |

### Organisational Fault

| Factor | Aggravating | Mitigating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Leadership involvement** | Senior management aware/directed | Management unaware |
| **Compliance culture** | Dismissive of compliance | Genuine compliance culture |
| **Resource allocation** | Compliance under-resourced | Adequate resources |
| **Training** | Staff untrained | Comprehensive training |
| **Monitoring** | No internal checks | Active self-monitoring |

---

## Factor 3: Mitigation and Corrective Actions

### Timing of Corrective Action

| Timing | Penalty Effect | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Before detection** | Significant mitigation | Self-identification records |
| **Immediately on detection** | Good mitigation | Response timeline |
| **During investigation** | Some mitigation | Cooperation records |
| **After enforcement** | Limited mitigation | Compliance plan |
| **No action** | Aggravating | N/A |

### Quality of Corrective Actions

| Action Quality | Assessment | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Comprehensive** | Full remediation of violation | Complete resolution |
| **Substantial** | Major steps, gaps remain | Significant improvement |
| **Partial** | Some improvement | Partial resolution |
| **Cosmetic** | Appearance only | No real change |
| **None** | No action taken | Continued violation |

### Documentation for Penalty Mitigation

| Document | Content | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Incident Timeline** | When discovered, steps taken, completion | Show prompt response |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | Why violation occurred, how prevented | Show understanding |
| **Remediation Plan** | Actions, responsibilities, timelines | Show commitment |
| **Implementation Evidence** | Completed actions, verification | Prove remediation |
| **Prevention Measures** | Systemic changes made | Prevent recurrence |

## Factor 4: Previous Violations

### History Assessment

| History | Impact | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **No prior violations** | Mitigating | First-time leniency |
| **Prior unrelated violations** | Neutral to slight aggravating | Depends on nature |
| **Prior similar violations** | Significantly aggravating | Pattern evidence |
| **Multiple prior violations** | Severely aggravating | Recidivist treatment |
| **Ongoing non-compliance** | Most aggravating | Structural failure |

### Time Factor

| Time Since Prior Violation | Weight |
| --- | --- |
| **< 2 years** | Full aggravating weight |
| **2-5 years** | Moderate weight |
| **5-10 years** | Reduced weight |
| **> 10 years** | Minimal weight |

### Cross-Regulation History

| Prior Regulation | Relevance |
| --- | --- |
| **AI Act violations** | Directly relevant |
| **GDPR violations** | Relevant for data/AI overlap |
| **Product safety violations** | Relevant for AI in products |
| **Other regulatory violations** | May indicate compliance culture |
