## Market Surveillance Framework Overview

Market surveillance ensures AI systems remain compliant throughout their lifecycle—from market placement through deployment and ongoing operation. Unlike one-time conformity assessment, surveillance is continuous and reactive to market developments.

### Legal Framework

| **Article 74** | Market surveillance and control | Authority powers, surveillance activities |
| **Article 75** | Mutual assistance | Cross-border cooperation |
| **Article 76** | Procedure at national level | National enforcement procedures |
| **Article 77** | Safeguard procedure | EU-wide protective measures |
| **Article 78** | Formal non-compliance | Procedural violations |

### Surveillance Objectives

| Objective | Activities | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Compliance verification** | Testing, documentation review | Confirm ongoing compliance |
| **Risk identification** | Incident monitoring, complaints | Detect emerging risks |
| **Enforcement** | Corrective measures, penalties | Address non-compliance |

- Surveillance can be triggered by **multiple sources**—complaints, incidents, random sampling, cross-border alerts
- Authorities have **extensive powers** including unannounced inspections, source code access, and system testing
- **Preparation is essential**—maintain inspection-ready documentation and trained personnel
- **Cooperation generally helps**—resistance tends to escalate, cooperation often leads to better outcomes
- **Cross-border coordination** means action in one Member State can affect others
- Develop a **surveillance response capability** before you need it—not during an investigation
