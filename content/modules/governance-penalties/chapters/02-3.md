## The AI Act Penalty Framework (Article 99)

The AI Act establishes one of the most significant penalty regimes in EU regulatory history, with maximum fines rivalling those under GDPR and exceeding many sector-specific regulations.

### Penalty Structure Overview

| Tier | Maximum Fine (€) | Maximum Fine (% Turnover) | Applicable Higher | Violations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tier 1** | €35 million | 7% worldwide turnover | Whichever is higher | Prohibited AI practices (Article 5) |
| **Tier 2** | €15 million | 3% worldwide turnover | Whichever is higher | Most AI Act requirements |
| **Tier 3** | €7.5 million | 1.5% worldwide turnover | Whichever is higher | Information violations |

---

## Tier 1: Prohibited AI Practices (€35M / 7%)

### Covered Violations

Tier 1 applies to violations of Article 5 prohibited AI practices:

| Prohibited Practice | Article | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Subliminal manipulation** | Article 5(1)(a) | Hidden persuasion techniques, dark patterns causing harm |
| **Exploitation of vulnerabilities** | Article 5(1)(b) | Targeting children, disabled persons, economically vulnerable |
| **Social scoring** | Article 5(1)(c) | General-purpose social credit systems |
| **Real-time remote biometric ID** | Article 5(1)(d) | Facial recognition in public spaces (law enforcement exceptions) |
| **Biometric categorisation** | Article 5(1)(g) | Inferring race, religion, sexual orientation from biometrics |
| **Emotion recognition in workplaces/schools** | Article 5(1)(f) | AI detecting emotions in employment/education contexts |
| **Predictive policing (individuals)** | Article 5(1)(d) | Crime prediction based solely on profiling |
| **Facial image scraping** | Article 5(1)(e) | Untargeted internet/CCTV facial database creation |

### Risk Assessment

| Factor | Impact on Risk |
| --- | --- |
| **Intentionality** | Deliberate prohibited use = maximum severity |
| **Scale** | Number of affected persons increases severity |
| **Duration** | Longer violation periods increase exposure |
| **Harm caused** | Actual harm to individuals raises severity |

> **Warning:** Prohibited practice violations carry the highest penalties and are likely enforcement priorities. Zero tolerance is the only acceptable approach.

---

## Tier 2: General AI Act Violations (€15M / 3%)

### Covered Violations

Tier 2 covers the broadest range of AI Act requirements:

| Category | Specific Violations | Article References |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **High-Risk AI Requirements** | Risk management, data governance, technical documentation, transparency, accuracy, human oversight, cybersecurity | Articles 8-15 |
| **Provider Obligations** | Quality management, conformity assessment, registration, post-market monitoring | Articles 16-25 |
| **Deployer Obligations** | Use in accordance with instructions, human oversight, data retention, transparency to users | Article 26 |
| **GPAI Obligations** | Technical documentation, copyright compliance, information provision, training data summary | Article 53 |
| **Systemic Risk GPAI** | Model evaluation, risk assessment, incident reporting, cybersecurity | Article 55 |
| **Transparency Requirements** | AI-generated content marking, disclosure of AI use | Articles 50, 52 |

### Violation Scenarios and Exposure

| Scenario | Likely Penalty Range | Factors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Complete absence of conformity assessment** | Upper range | Fundamental breach |
| **Documentation gaps** | Mid range | Depends on severity |
| **Minor technical non-compliance** | Lower range | If good faith evident |
| **Multiple concurrent violations** | Cumulative | Each violation assessed |
| **Systemic compliance failure** | Upper range | Organisational culpability |

---

## Tier 3: Information Violations (€7.5M / 1.5%)

### Covered Violations

Tier 3 addresses the integrity of regulatory information:

| Violation | Description | Context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Incorrect information** | Factually wrong information provided | Response to authority requests |
| **Incomplete information** | Material omissions | Failing to disclose relevant facts |
| **Misleading information** | Information designed to deceive | Creating false impressions |
| **Information to notified bodies** | False information to conformity assessors | Conformity assessment process |
| **Information to authorities** | False information to competent authorities | Investigations, audits |

### Aggravating Circumstances

| Circumstance | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Deliberate falsification** | Upper penalty range |
| **Obstruction of investigation** | Severe view taken |
| **Repeat information violations** | Cumulative penalties possible |
| **Material impact on decisions** | Higher severity |

> **Expert Insight:** Tier 3 is often underestimated but can be particularly damaging. Beyond the direct penalty, information violations undermine trust with authorities and may lead to enhanced scrutiny of all compliance claims.

## Turnover Calculation

### Basic Calculation (Article 99(3))

| Element | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Total worldwide annual turnover** | Full annual revenue from all sources |
| **Preceding financial year** | Most recent complete financial year |
| **Worldwide** | Global turnover, not EU only |
| **Undertaking** | Economic unit, may include parent company |

### Group and Parent Company Considerations

| Scenario | Turnover Basis |
| --- | --- |
| **Subsidiary violator** | May include parent company turnover |
| **Joint ventures** | Depends on control and economic unity |
| **Group economic unit** | Consolidated group turnover possible |
| **Multiple subsidiaries** | Combined entity assessment |

### Calculation Examples

| Company Profile | Turnover | Tier 1 (7%) | Tier 2 (3%) | Tier 3 (1.5%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Large multinational** | €50 billion | €3.5 billion | €1.5 billion | €750 million |
| **Mid-size enterprise** | €500 million | €35 million (cap) | €15 million (cap) | €7.5 million (cap) |
| **Growth company** | €100 million | €35 million (cap) | €15 million (cap) | €7.5 million (cap) |
| **SME** | €5 million | €350,000 | €150,000 | €75,000 |
| **Startup** | €500,000 | €35,000 | €15,000 | €7,500 |

### "Whichever is Higher" Rule

| Company | Turnover | Fixed Cap | % Calculation | Applied Penalty (Tier 1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **TechCorp** | €100 billion | €35 million | €7 billion | **€7 billion** (% higher) |
| **MidTech** | €400 million | €35 million | €28 million | **€35 million** (cap higher) |
| **SmallTech** | €10 million | €35 million | €700,000 | **€35 million** (cap higher) |

---

## SME and Startup Provisions (Article 99(5))

### Proportionality Requirements

The AI Act requires proportionate treatment of SMEs and startups:

| Provision | Application |
| --- | --- |
| **Lower cap applies** | SMEs benefit from fixed € amount if lower than % |
| **Financial capacity** | Must consider ability to pay |
| **Proportionality** | Penalty must be proportionate to violation |
| **First infringement** | Mitigating factor for SMEs |
| **Good faith efforts** | Compliance efforts considered |

### SME Definition

| Criteria | Micro | Small | Medium |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Employees** | < 10 | < 50 | < 250 |
| **Annual turnover** | ≤ €2 million | ≤ €10 million | ≤ €50 million |
| **Balance sheet** | ≤ €2 million | ≤ €10 million | ≤ €43 million |

### Practical Effect for SMEs

| SME Size | Tier 1 Exposure | Tier 2 Exposure | Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Medium (€50M)** | Up to €3.5M (7%) | Up to €1.5M (3%) | Still significant |
| **Small (€10M)** | Up to €700K (7%) | Up to €300K (3%) | Material but survivable |
| **Micro (€2M)** | Up to €140K (7%) | Up to €60K (3%) | Could threaten viability |

## Penalty Avoidance Strategy

### Risk Prioritisation

| Priority | Violation Type | Action | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Critical** | Prohibited practices | Complete elimination | Tier 1 penalties, no justification |
| **High** | High-risk AI without conformity | Full conformity assessment | Core requirement, high visibility |
| **High** | GPAI documentation gaps | Complete documentation | AI Office enforcement active |
| **Medium** | Transparency violations | Implement disclosures | User-facing, detectable |
| **Medium** | Post-market monitoring gaps | Establish systems | Ongoing compliance |
| **Lower** | Minor documentation deficiencies | Remediation plan | Good faith efforts count |

## Key Takeaways

- The AI Act establishes **three penalty tiers** with maximum fines of €35M/7%, €15M/3%, and €7.5M/1.5%
- **"Whichever is higher"** means large companies face % turnover penalties, smaller companies face fixed € amounts
- **Turnover calculation** includes worldwide turnover and may include parent company/group turnover
- **SMEs and startups** benefit from proportionality requirements, but penalties can still be significant relative to size
- AI Act penalties are **among the highest in EU law**, comparable to GDPR and competition law
- **Prohibited practices** (Tier 1) should be treated with zero tolerance—these are enforcement priorities
- **Proactive compliance** is the best penalty avoidance strategy—the cost of non-compliance far exceeds compliance investment
