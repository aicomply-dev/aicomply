| **European AI Board** | Article 65 | EU | Coordination, guidance | National authority representatives |
| **Scientific Panel** | Article 68 | EU | Technical expertise | Independent scientific experts |
| **Advisory Forum** | Article 67 | EU | Stakeholder input | Industry, civil society, academia |
