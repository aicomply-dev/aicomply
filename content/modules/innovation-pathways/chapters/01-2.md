## Introduction: Making Sandboxes Work for You

Regulatory sandboxes are only valuable if you participate effectively. This chapter provides a practical roadmap for navigating the sandbox process—from initial application through successful exit.

> **Expert Insight:** The organisations that get the most from sandbox participation are those that come prepared with clear questions and engage actively with regulators. Don't treat it as a checkbox—treat it as a consulting engagement with the regulator.

## Phase 1: Pre-Application Preparation

### Readiness Assessment

Before applying, honestly assess your readiness:

| Readiness Factor | Questions to Ask | Minimum Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **System maturity** | Is the AI system developed enough to test meaningfully? | Beyond concept, at least prototype stage |
| **Team capacity** | Can we dedicate resources to sandbox activities? | Named project lead + technical support |
| **Documentation state** | Do we have preliminary documentation? | Basic system description, risk assessment draft |
| **Safeguards capability** | Can we implement required protections? | GDPR compliance, human oversight capability |
| **Timeline flexibility** | Can we commit 6-24 months to the process? | No immovable market deadlines |

### Strategic Sandbox Selection

| Sandbox Type | Best For | Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **National sandbox (home Member State)** | Standard applications, local market focus | Fastest access, familiar jurisdiction |
| **National sandbox (target market)** | Market-specific compliance questions | May require local presence/representative |
| **Joint sandbox (multi-Member State)** | Cross-border applications, harmonised approach | Broader validity, potentially more complex |
| **AI Office sandbox (GPAI)** | General-purpose AI models | Commission-run, GPAI-specific expertise |

### Identifying Your Sandbox

| Research Source | Information Available |
| --- | --- |
| **National competent authority website** | Application process, criteria, timelines |
| **European Commission AI Office** | GPAI sandbox information, guidelines |
| **Industry associations** | Peer experiences, recommendations |
| **AI Act implementation tracker** | Status of sandbox establishment per Member State |

### Application Components

| Component | Contents | Tips for Success |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Executive summary** | One-page overview of AI system and sandbox objectives | Make value proposition clear for regulators |
| **System description** | Technical and functional description of the AI | Be specific but accessible to non-technical readers |
| **Use case and context** | How the AI will be deployed, who is affected | Emphasise public benefit and rights considerations |
| **Risk classification** | Your assessment of the risk level | Acknowledge uncertainty—that's why you're applying |
| **Compliance questions** | Specific guidance you're seeking | Be concrete—vague questions get vague answers |
| **Proposed testing plan** | What you want to test, how, with whom | Show you've thought through safeguards |
| **Safeguards plan** | How you'll protect affected persons | This is critical—inadequate safeguards = rejection |
| **Resource commitment** | Team, time, and budget allocated | Demonstrate serious commitment |
| **Timeline and milestones** | Proposed sandbox duration and phases | Be realistic, allow for iteration |

### Common Application Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | How to Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vague compliance questions** | Authorities can't provide targeted guidance | List specific articles and requirements you need clarity on |
| **Insufficient safeguards** | Application rejected or heavily conditioned | Design safeguards that exceed minimum expectations |
| **Unrealistic timeline** | Undermines credibility, leads to extensions | Research typical durations, add contingency |
| **Missing documentation** | Delays review, poor first impression | Use the checklist, have colleagues review |
| **Overselling innovation** | Authorities are sceptical of hype | Focus on substance, acknowledge limitations |

---

## Phase 3: Plan Negotiation

### What the Sandbox Plan Covers

| Plan Element | Authority Perspective | Participant Perspective |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Objectives** | What compliance questions will be answered? | What clarity will we gain? |
| **Scope** | What is being tested, what is excluded? | What's the boundary of sandbox protection? |
| **Duration** | Is the timeline realistic for meaningful testing? | How long is our commitment? |
| **Milestones** | How will we track progress? | What do we need to deliver when? |
| **Testing conditions** | Are safeguards adequate? | What are our operational constraints? |
| **Supervision** | How often do we need to meet? | What's our reporting burden? |
| **Exit criteria** | What defines successful completion? | When are we done? |
| **Confidentiality** | What can be shared publicly? | Is our IP protected? |

### Negotiation Strategies

| Strategy | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Come prepared** | Draft the plan yourself first—it's easier to negotiate from a position |
| **Understand their constraints** | Authorities have limited resources; make supervision easy for them |
| **Ask for specificity** | Vague plans lead to vague outcomes; push for concrete criteria |
| **Build in flexibility** | AI development is uncertain; include provisions for plan amendments |
| **Clarify confidentiality** | Ensure you understand what's public and what's protected |
| **Document everything** | The written plan is your protection; ensure it accurately reflects agreements |

## Phase 4: Active Participation

### Operating Within the Sandbox

| Activity | Frequency | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Progress reporting** | Monthly/quarterly | Keep authority informed, identify issues early |
| **Supervision meetings** | Per agreed schedule | Direct guidance, relationship building |
| **Incident reporting** | Immediately upon occurrence | Mandatory, protects participants and affected persons |
| **Documentation updates** | Ongoing | Evidence for exit assessment |
| **Plan amendments** | As needed | Adjust scope/timeline based on learnings |

### Maximising Regulatory Guidance

| Approach | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Ask specific questions** | "Does our approach to X satisfy Article Y(Z)?" not "Is this compliant?" |
| **Bring evidence** | Show documentation, demonstrate systems, provide examples |
| **Test interpretations** | "Our reading of this requirement is X—do you agree?" |
| **Iterate openly** | Share your compliance iterations; get feedback before finalising |
| **Document guidance** | Write up what was said and confirm understanding in writing |

> **Expert Insight:** The regulators you work with in the sandbox will develop expertise in your system. They become advocates for reasonable compliance approaches because they understand the technology. Invest in that relationship.

### Incident Management in Sandbox

| Incident Type | Reporting Requirement | Actions Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Minor technical issue** | Next supervision meeting | Document and explain mitigation |
| **Safeguard breach** | Within 24 hours | Immediate containment, investigation, remediation |
| **Harm to affected person** | Immediately | Stop testing, notify authority, support affected person |
| **Fundamental rights impact** | Immediately | As above, plus potential sandbox suspension |

## Phase 5: Exit and Transition

### Exit Assessment Process

| Stage | Authority Activities | Participant Activities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Preparation** | Review all documentation, plan final assessment | Compile evidence, prepare summary |
| **Assessment** | Evaluate against requirements, identify gaps | Respond to queries, provide clarification |
| **Report drafting** | Draft exit report with findings | Review draft, request corrections |
| **Finalisation** | Issue final exit report | Accept report, plan next steps |

### Understanding Your Exit Report

| Report Section | What It Means | How to Use It |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Compliance findings** | Authority's assessment of your approach | Evidence for conformity assessment |
| **Recommendations** | Suggested improvements or changes | Roadmap for market readiness |
| **Conditions** | Requirements for market entry | Must-do list before launch |
| **Outstanding issues** | Unresolved questions | Further work or clarification needed |
| **EU-wide validity statement** | Confirmation of cross-border recognition | Use when entering other Member State markets |

### Post-Sandbox Transition

| Transition Activity | Timing | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Implement recommendations** | Immediately after exit | Address identified gaps |
| **Update documentation** | Before conformity assessment | Reflect final system state |
| **Conformity assessment** | After recommendations implemented | Formal compliance validation |
| **CE marking and DoC** | After conformity assessment | Market entry prerequisites |
| **Market entry** | After all requirements met | Launch |

## Special Situations

### Extending Sandbox Participation

| Reason for Extension | Process | Likely Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Additional testing needed** | Request with justification | Usually granted if reasonable |
| **Scope expansion** | Negotiate plan amendment | May require re-application |
| **External delays** | Explain circumstances | Extensions for force majeure typical |
| **Repeated extensions** | Requires strong justification | May indicate project viability issues |

### Early Exit

| Reason | Process | Consequences |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Project cancellation** | Notify authority, provide explanation | No exit report, lost investment |
| **Achieved objectives early** | Request early exit assessment | Positive outcome, efficient use of sandbox |
| **Fundamental redesign needed** | Discuss with authority | May exit and reapply with new system |
| **Authority termination** | Compliance with termination requirements | May have negative implications |

### Dispute Resolution

| Issue | Resolution Path |
| --- | --- |
| **Disagreement on plan interpretation** | Escalate within authority, seek written clarification |
| **Unfair treatment concern** | Formal complaint to supervisory body |
| **Exit report disagreement** | Appeal process (varies by Member State) |
