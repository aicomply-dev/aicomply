# Real-World Testing (Article 60)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand when and how real-world testing is permitted under Article 60
- Design testing plans that meet regulatory requirements
- Implement informed consent procedures compliant with the AI Act
- Establish monitoring and safeguard frameworks for live testing
- Document real-world testing to support conformity assessment

---

## Introduction: Testing in the Real World

Laboratory testing and simulations have limits. At some point, AI systems must be tested in real-world conditions to validate performance. Article 60 provides a framework for such testing—balancing the need for realistic validation against the protection of affected persons.

> **Expert Insight:** Real-world testing is where theory meets practice. The AI Act doesn't prohibit it—it requires that you do it responsibly. A well-designed testing program actually strengthens your conformity assessment by providing real-world performance evidence.

## Legal Framework (Article 60)

### When Real-World Testing Applies

| Condition | Article 60 Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **System type** | High-risk AI systems under Annex III |
| **Lifecycle stage** | Before placing on market or putting into service |
| **Purpose** | Testing performance under real-world conditions |
| **Approval pathway** | Either within a sandbox OR with approved testing plan |
| **Safeguards** | Subject to specific protections for affected persons |

### Article 60 vs. Sandbox Testing

## Informed Consent Framework

### Consent Requirements (Article 60(4)(c))

| Requirement | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Free** | No coercion, pressure, or undue inducement |
| **Specific** | Relates to this particular testing, not general |
| **Informed** | Subject understands what they're consenting to |
| **Unambiguous** | Clear affirmative action (not passive acceptance) |
| **Documented** | Written or electronic record of consent |
| **Withdrawable** | Subject can withdraw at any time without consequence |

### Information to Provide

Before consent, test subjects must be informed about:

| Information Element | Example Content |
| --- | --- |
| **Nature of the AI system** | "This AI analyses your responses to assess creditworthiness" |
| **Purpose of testing** | "We are testing the system's accuracy before market launch" |
| **How they will be affected** | "The AI will evaluate your application alongside our standard process" |
| **Risks and safeguards** | "There is a risk of incorrect assessment; human review verifies all decisions" |
| **Data collection and use** | "Your data will be used for testing only and deleted after 12 months" |
| **Duration of participation** | "Testing lasts 3 months; your involvement is for one application" |
| **Right to withdraw** | "You can withdraw at any time; your application continues normally" |
| **Contact for questions** | "Contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@company.com" |

### Consent Exceptions

| Situation | Exception Basis | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Law enforcement/migration** | Article 60(4)(c) exception | Ethics committee approval, specific safeguards |
| **Emergency situations** | Not explicitly addressed | Likely requires post-hoc consent or exemption |

> ⚠️ **Warning:** The consent exception for law enforcement and migration is narrow and requires enhanced safeguards. Don't assume it applies—seek legal advice before using this exception.

| **Incident detection** | Automated and manual detection | Identify problems early |
| **Subject feedback** | Channels for concerns/complaints | Capture subjective impacts |
| **Documentation** | Comprehensive logging | Evidence for conformity assessment |

### Intervention Triggers

Define clear thresholds for action:

| Trigger | Response |
| --- | --- |
| **Performance below threshold** | Pause testing, investigate, remediate |
| **Bias detected** | Suspend testing for affected groups, analyse |
| **Harm to subject** | Stop testing immediately, support subject, report |
| **Subject withdrawal** | Remove from testing, honour consent revocation |
| **Authority request** | Immediate compliance with authority instructions |

### Human Oversight During Testing

| Oversight Type | When Required | Implementation |
