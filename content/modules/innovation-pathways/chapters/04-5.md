# SME and Start-up Support

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Identify all SME and start-up support provisions throughout the AI Act
- Navigate priority access to regulatory sandboxes
- Understand proportionate penalty treatment for smaller organisations
- Access available guidance, templates, and support channels
- Develop cost-effective compliance strategies appropriate for SMEs

---

## Introduction: Why SME Support Matters

The EU recognises that compliance costs can disproportionately burden smaller organisations. An SME spending €100,000 on compliance faces a fundamentally different challenge than a large enterprise with dedicated regulatory teams. The AI Act addresses this through specific provisions designed to support SMEs and start-ups.

> **Expert Insight:** The AI Act's SME provisions aren't just about lower penalties—they're about ensuring smaller innovators can compete. The priority sandbox access and support measures can actually give SMEs advantages if used strategically.

## Who Qualifies as an SME?

### EU SME Definition

| Category | Staff Headcount | Annual Turnover | OR | Balance Sheet Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Micro** | < 10 | ≤ €2 million | OR | ≤ €2 million |
| **Small** | < 50 | ≤ €10 million | OR | ≤ €10 million |
| **Medium** | < 250 | ≤ €50 million | OR | ≤ €43 million |

### Start-up Considerations

While the AI Act doesn't specifically define "start-up," common criteria include:
- Recently incorporated (typically < 5-7 years)
- Innovative business model or technology
- Growth-oriented
- Often venture-backed or scaling

### Verification Requirements

| When Required | What to Provide |
| --- | --- |
| **Sandbox application** | Self-declaration, may require verification |
| **Penalty assessment** | Financial data, ownership structure |
| **Accessing support measures** | Evidence of SME status per EU definition |

---

## Priority Sandbox Access (Article 57)

### What "Priority" Means

| Aspect | Standard Applicant | SME/Start-up Applicant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Queue position** | Based on application order/merit | Prioritised access |
| **Fees** | May apply | Free of charge (Article 57(7)) |
| **Guidance** | Standard support | Tailored to SME constraints |
| **Capacity allocation** | Competitive | Dedicated SME slots |

### Article 57(7) Provisions

| Provision | Benefit for SMEs |
| --- | --- |
| **Priority access** | Sandboxes shall be accessible to SMEs and start-ups on a priority basis |
| **Free participation** | Shall not entail costs for SME participants |
| **Specific needs consideration** | Authorities shall take SME constraints into account |

### Maximising Sandbox Benefits

| Strategy | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Apply early** | Take advantage of priority before capacity fills |
| **Be specific** | Clear compliance questions get targeted guidance |
| **Document learnings** | Sandbox guidance reduces future compliance costs |
| **Network** | Connect with other SMEs in sandbox |

## Proportionate Penalty Framework

### How Article 99 Protects SMEs

| Penalty Tier | General Cap | SME Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Prohibited practices** | €35M or 7% global turnover | Lower of the two caps applies |
| **High-risk non-compliance** | €15M or 3% global turnover | Lower of the two caps applies |
| **Other violations** | €7.5M or 1.5% global turnover | Lower of the two caps applies |

### Proportionality Factors

| Factor | How It Benefits SMEs |
| --- | --- |
| **Size and resources** | Smaller penalties for smaller organisations |
| **Economic viability** | Penalties shouldn't threaten business survival |
| **First infringement** | More lenient treatment for first offences |
| **Good faith efforts** | Genuine compliance attempts considered |
| **Cooperation** | Working with authorities reduces penalties |

### Practical Example

```
SCENARIO: SME with €5M annual turnover, first high-risk violation

Standard cap: Lower of €15M or 3% of turnover
- €15M (fixed cap)
- €150,000 (3% of €5M)
→ Cap is €150,000 (the lower amount)

Plus proportionality considerations:
- First offence: further reduction likely
- SME status: additional consideration
- Good faith efforts: potential further mitigation
- Actual penalty: significantly below cap
```

> **Expert Insight:** Penalties for SMEs are genuinely proportionate in practice. I've seen enforcement actions where SMEs received penalties 10-20% of what a large enterprise would face for similar violations—if they demonstrated good faith.

## Building an SME Compliance Programme

| **Phase 5: Ongoing** | Maintain compliance, monitor updates | Ongoing part-time effort |

### Proportionate Resourcing

| SME Size | Suggested Resourcing |
| --- | --- |
| **Micro (< 10 employees)** | Part-time responsibility, external support for complex issues |
| **Small (< 50 employees)** | Named compliance lead (not full-time), periodic external review |
| **Medium (< 250 employees)** | Dedicated compliance resource, may be shared with other regulatory areas |

### When to Seek External Help
