# Codes of Conduct (Article 95)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain the legal framework and purpose of codes of conduct under Article 95
- Distinguish between mandatory obligations and voluntary commitments
- Evaluate whether to adopt or develop a code of conduct for your organisation
- Identify key elements of effective codes of conduct
- Understand how codes of conduct intersect with sustainability and accessibility

## Introduction: Beyond Compliance

The AI Act establishes mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems—but what about the majority of AI systems that fall outside the high-risk category? Article 95 encourages the development of voluntary codes of conduct that extend trustworthy AI principles to all AI systems.

> **Expert Insight:** Codes of conduct represent the AI Act's "soft power"—encouraging responsible AI development even where hard legal requirements don't apply. Organisations that embrace these principles often find they're better prepared if regulations tighten or if their AI systems are later classified as high-risk.

## Legal Framework (Article 95)

### What Article 95 Establishes

| Provision | Content |
| --- | --- |
| **Encouragement** | Commission and Member States shall encourage drawing up of codes of conduct |
| **Scope** | Applicable to AI systems other than high-risk AI systems |
| **Purpose** | Voluntary application of requirements for high-risk AI systems |
| **Sustainability** | Specific focus on environmental sustainability |
| **Accessibility** | Consideration of accessibility for persons with disabilities |
| **Stakeholder input** | Codes shall take into account input from relevant stakeholders |

### Commission and Member State Role

| Activity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Facilitate development** | Provide guidance, convene stakeholders, support drafting |
| **Take stock of existing codes** | Consider industry initiatives already in place |
| **Consider SME needs** | Ensure codes are accessible to smaller organisations |
| **Promote uptake** | Encourage adoption through awareness and incentives |
| **Monitor effectiveness** | Track impact and adjust approach as needed |

---

## Scope: What Codes of Conduct Cover

### AI Systems in Scope

| System Category | In Scope for Codes of Conduct? | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Minimal risk AI** | Yes—primary target | No mandatory requirements, codes fill the gap |
| **Limited risk AI** | Yes—beyond transparency requirements | Transparency required, codes add broader principles |
| **High-risk AI** | Not the focus, but can complement | Mandatory requirements already apply |
| **Prohibited AI** | No | These practices are banned, not subject to voluntary codes |

### Subject Matter Areas

Article 95 specifically mentions several focus areas:

| Area | Article 95 Reference | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **High-risk requirements** | Article 95(1) | Voluntary application of Articles 8-15 |
| **Environmental sustainability** | Article 95(1)(a) | Energy efficiency, carbon footprint, sustainable design |
| **Accessibility** | Article 95(1)(b) | AI usable by persons with disabilities |
| **Stakeholder participation** | Article 95(1)(c) | Involving affected groups in AI design |
| **Diversity** | Article 95(1)(d) | Diverse development teams |
| **Environmental impact measurement** | Article 95(2) | Tracking and reporting sustainability metrics |

---

## Voluntary Application of High-Risk Requirements

### Which Requirements to Consider

| Requirement Area | Article | Voluntary Application Benefits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Risk management** | Article 9 | Identify and mitigate risks proactively |
| **Data governance** | Article 10 | Improve data quality, reduce bias |
| **Documentation** | Article 11 | Better internal knowledge, easier maintenance |
| **Record-keeping** | Article 12 | Accountability, debugging capability |
| **Transparency** | Article 13 | User trust, clearer communication |
| **Human oversight** | Article 14 | Better decisions, reduced automation failures |
| **Accuracy and robustness** | Article 15 | Higher quality systems, fewer failures |

> **Expert Insight:** Organisations that voluntarily apply high-risk requirements to their non-high-risk AI often find unexpected benefits: better quality systems, fewer production issues, and easier scaling when they do develop high-risk AI.

## Environmental Sustainability

### AI's Environmental Footprint

| Impact Area | Concern | Code of Conduct Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Training compute** | Large models require massive energy | Efficient training practices, renewable energy |
| **Inference energy** | Ongoing energy for AI operations | Model optimisation, efficient hardware |
| **Hardware lifecycle** | Manufacturing, disposal of AI hardware | Sustainable procurement, recycling |
| **Data centres** | Cooling, power infrastructure | Green data centre practices |

### Sustainability Commitments in Codes

| Commitment Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Measurement** | Track and report AI carbon footprint |
| **Reduction targets** | Reduce AI energy consumption by X% per year |
| **Efficiency practices** | Implement model compression, pruning, quantisation |
| **Renewable energy** | Power AI workloads with renewable sources |
| **Hardware choices** | Select energy-efficient hardware |
| **Lifecycle consideration** | Factor sustainability into AI design decisions |

### Article 95(2): Specific Sustainability Provisions

The AI Act specifically calls for codes of conduct to include:

| Provision | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Environmental impact measurement** | Methodologies for measuring AI's environmental footprint |
| **Resource consumption tracking** | Monitor energy, water, materials usage |
| **Reporting mechanisms** | Standardised reporting of environmental metrics |
| **Improvement targets** | Set and track sustainability goals |

---

## Accessibility

### Making AI Accessible

| Accessibility Principle | Application to AI |
| --- | --- |
| **Perceivable** | AI outputs can be perceived by all users (text alternatives, etc.) |
| **Operable** | AI interfaces can be operated by all users |
| **Understandable** | AI explanations are comprehensible to diverse users |
| **Robust** | AI works with assistive technologies |

### Specific Considerations

| User Group | AI Accessibility Considerations |
| --- | --- |
| **Visual impairment** | Text alternatives for visual AI outputs, screen reader compatibility |
| **Hearing impairment** | Captions for audio, visual alternatives for voice interfaces |
| **Motor impairment** | Alternative input methods, voice control |
| **Cognitive differences** | Clear explanations, appropriate complexity levels |

> **Expert Insight:** Accessibility isn't just ethical—it's good business. Making AI accessible expands your user base and often improves usability for everyone. Codes of conduct that emphasise accessibility signal inclusive design values.

## Adopting vs. Developing Codes

### Strategic Options

| Option | When Appropriate | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Join existing code** | Industry code exists, fits your needs | Faster, established credibility | Less tailored to your context |
| **Develop new code** | No suitable code exists, unique needs | Fully customised | Resource-intensive |
| **Adapt existing code** | Existing code needs customisation | Balance of fit and efficiency | May require negotiation |
| **Internal code only** | Competitive differentiation, unique approach | Full control | Less external credibility |

### Considerations for SMEs

| Factor | SME Approach |
| --- | --- |
| **Resources** | Join existing codes rather than developing new ones |
| **Credibility** | Leverage established industry code reputation |
| **Flexibility** | Choose codes with proportionate requirements |
| **Demonstration** | Use code adoption as trust signal to customers |

---

## Benefits of Code Adoption

### Business Benefits

| **Customer trust** | Demonstrates responsible AI commitment |
| **Competitive differentiation** | Stand out from competitors |
| **Risk management** | Proactive approach reduces future issues |
| **Regulatory readiness** | Prepared if requirements tighten |
| **Talent attraction** | Ethical AI attracts principled employees |
| **Stakeholder relations** | Positive engagement with civil society, regulators |

### Operational Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Quality improvement** | Code requirements drive better practices |
| **Knowledge building** | Documentation and transparency improve internal understanding |
| **Issue prevention** | Proactive risk management catches problems early |
