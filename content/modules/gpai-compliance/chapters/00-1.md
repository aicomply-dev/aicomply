Chapter V of the AI Act introduces a distinct regulatory framework for General-Purpose AI (GPAI) models. This represents a significant regulatory innovation—recognising that foundation models and large language models present unique governance challenges due to their versatility and potential for widespread downstream use.

## Legal Definition of GPAI Models

### Article 3(63) Definition

**"General-purpose AI model"** means an AI model, including where such an AI model is trained with a large amount of data using self-supervision at scale, that displays significant generality and is capable of competently performing a wide range of distinct tasks regardless of the way the model is placed on the market and that can be integrated into a variety of downstream systems or applications.

### Breaking Down the Definition

| Element | Interpretation | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AI model** | The trained model itself, not applications built on it | Model weights, architecture, parameters |
| **Significant generality** | Not limited to narrow, predefined tasks | Can handle diverse input types and requests |
| **Wide range of distinct tasks** | Competent across multiple domains | Writing, coding, analysis, translation |
| **Integration capability** | Can be incorporated into downstream systems | Via API, fine-tuning, or embedding |
| **Regardless of market placement** | Applies whether commercial, free, or open source | Includes open-weight releases |

> 💡 **Expert Insight:** The definition focuses on **capability**, not intended use. A model with general capabilities is a GPAI model even if the provider markets it for specific applications.

### The "Foundation Model" Relationship

While the AI Act uses "GPAI model," this concept aligns closely with what the AI community calls "foundation models"—large-scale models trained on broad data that can be adapted to many downstream tasks. Key characteristics:

| Characteristic | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Scale** | Trained on massive datasets (terabytes of text, billions of images) |
| **Self-supervision** | Often trained using self-supervised learning techniques |
| **Emergence** | May exhibit emergent capabilities not explicitly trained |
| **Adaptability** | Can be fine-tuned, prompted, or integrated for diverse applications |
| **Generality** | Competent across multiple distinct task categories |

## Examples: GPAI vs. Non-GPAI

### Clear GPAI Model Examples

| Model Type | Why It's GPAI |
| --- | --- |
| **Large Language Models** (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama) | Generality across NLP tasks, integration into diverse applications |
| **Multi-modal Foundation Models** | Handle text, images, audio; wide task range |
| **Code Generation Models** | Generalise across programming tasks and languages |
| **General Image Generation** (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Midjourney) | Create diverse images from text prompts |
| **General Speech Models** | Transcription, translation, synthesis across languages |

### NOT GPAI Models

| System Type | Why It's Not GPAI |
| --- | --- |
| **Task-specific classifiers** | Fraud detection model for one bank's transactions |
| **Narrow recommendation systems** | Product recommender for single e-commerce site |
| **Specific diagnostic AI** | Cancer detection for specific imaging modality |
| **Single-purpose chatbots** | FAQ bot trained only on company documentation |
| **Embedded AI in products** | AI controlling specific appliance functions |

### Edge Cases Requiring Analysis

| System | Analysis Required |
| --- | --- |
| **Fine-tuned LLM for customer service** | Base model is GPAI; fine-tuned version for narrow use may not be |
| **Domain-specific language model** | If still displays significant generality, likely GPAI |
| **Multi-task learning model** | Depends on breadth of tasks and integration potential |
| **Smaller general-purpose models** | Size alone doesn't determine status; generality does |

> ⚠️ **Classification Challenge:** The boundary between "general-purpose" and "specific" is not always clear. When uncertain, assess whether the model displays "significant generality" for a "wide range of distinct tasks."

## GPAI Model Provider Definition

### Article 3(66) Definition

**"Provider of a general-purpose AI model"** means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that develops a general-purpose AI model or that has a general-purpose AI model developed and places it on the market.

### When Are You a GPAI Provider?

| Scenario | GPAI Provider Status | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Develop and release LLM under your brand | **Yes** | Direct development + market placement |
| Commission GPAI development, release under your brand | **Yes** | "Has developed" + market placement |
| Fine-tune third-party GPAI for internal use only | **Likely No** | No market placement |
| Fine-tune and release modified GPAI | **May become provider** | Depends on modification substantiality |
| Distribute unmodified third-party GPAI | **Distributor, not provider** | Original provider remains responsible |
| Integrate GPAI into specific application | **Downstream provider** (AI system) | Different obligations apply |

### Free and Open Source Considerations

**Article 53(2)** addresses open source GPAI:

| Model Type | Obligations |
| --- | --- |
| **Free/open source GPAI (standard)** | Reduced obligations: copyright policy + training data summary |
| **Free/open source GPAI with systemic risk** | Full systemic risk obligations apply |
| **Commercial GPAI** | All GPAI obligations apply |

> 💡 **Open Source Distinction:** Open source GPAI benefits from reduced requirements, but this exemption does **not** apply if the model presents systemic risk (e.g., exceeds 10^25 FLOPS threshold).

## The GPAI-AI System Distinction

### Different Regulatory Frameworks

| Concept | Regulation | Key Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GPAI Model** | Chapter V (Articles 51-56) | The underlying model itself; provider obligations |
| **AI System** | Chapters II-IV | Application using AI; may be high-risk |
| **High-Risk AI System** | Chapter III | Specific use cases with mandatory requirements |

### How They Interact

```
GPAI Model (e.g., GPT-4)
         ↓
    [Integration]
         ↓
Downstream AI System (e.g., HR screening tool using GPT-4)
         ↓
    [If high-risk use case]
         ↓
High-Risk AI Obligations Apply (to downstream provider)
```

**Key Principle:** GPAI model obligations apply to the model provider. If the GPAI is integrated into a high-risk AI system, the downstream provider bears high-risk compliance obligations.

### Cumulative Obligations Example

| Actor | Role | Obligations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OpenAI** | GPAI provider (GPT-4) | Chapter V: technical docs, copyright, training summary |
| **HR Tech Company** | Downstream provider (uses GPT-4 in recruitment tool) | Chapter III: risk management, data governance, conformity assessment |
| **Employer** | Deployer | Article 26: instructions compliance, human oversight, FRIA |

## GPAI Model Classification Framework

### Classification Decision Tree

**Step 1:** Does the AI model display "significant generality"?
- If No → Not GPAI → Standard AI system rules apply
- If Yes → Proceed to Step 2

**Step 2:** Is it "capable of competently performing a wide range of distinct tasks"?
- If No → May not be GPAI → Analyse further
- If Yes → Proceed to Step 3

**Step 3:** Can it be "integrated into a variety of downstream systems or applications"?
- If No → May not be GPAI → Analyse integration potential
- If Yes → **GPAI Model** → Proceed to Step 4

**Step 4:** Does it present systemic risk (>10^25 FLOPS or Commission designation)?
- If Yes → **GPAI Model with Systemic Risk** → Enhanced obligations
- If No → **Standard GPAI Model** → Baseline obligations

### Classification Documentation

When classifying a model, document:

- [ ] Model architecture and training approach
- [ ] Range of tasks the model can perform
- [ ] Integration capabilities and APIs
- [ ] Computational resources used in training
- [ ] Reasoning for GPAI/non-GPAI determination
- [ ] Date of classification assessment
- [ ] Plan for re-assessment if model capabilities change

## Compliance Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
| --- | --- |
| **August 2, 2024** | AI Act enters into force |
| **August 2, 2025** | GPAI obligations apply (Chapter V) |
| **August 2, 2026** | High-risk AI obligations apply (Chapter III) |
| **August 2, 2027** | Existing GPAI models must comply |

> ⚠️ **Important:** GPAI models placed on market before August 2, 2025 have until August 2, 2027 to achieve full compliance. New GPAI models from August 2, 2025 must comply immediately.
