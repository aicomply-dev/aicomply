## Step 1: GPAI Classification Analysis

### Is EFAI-Alpha a GPAI Model?

Apply the Article 3(63) definition systematically:

| Criterion | Analysis | Conclusion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **"AI model"** | Neural network trained to predict next token | Yes |
| **"Displays significant generality"** | Performs across languages, domains, task types | Yes |
| **"Capable of competently performing wide range of distinct tasks"** | Succeeds at translation, QA, summarisation, coding, analysis | Yes |
| **"Can be integrated into variety of downstream systems or applications"** | Licensed for diverse applications via API | Yes |

**Classification Result:** EFAI-Alpha **is** a GPAI model under Article 3(63).

### Systemic Risk Assessment

| Factor | Analysis | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Training Compute** | 8.2 × 10^24 FLOPS | Below 10^25 threshold |
| **Commission Designation** | Not designated | N/A |
| **High-Impact Capabilities** | No exceptional capabilities beyond comparable models | Standard capabilities |

**Systemic Risk Result:** EFAI-Alpha is **not** a systemic risk model. Standard GPAI obligations under Article 53 apply.

> **Expert Note:** At 8.2 × 10^24 FLOPS, EFAI-Alpha is approaching the systemic risk threshold. EuroFoundation AI should prepare for potential classification if they plan to scale further. We'll address transition planning at the end of this case study.
