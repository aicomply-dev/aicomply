# GPAI Provider Obligations (Article 53)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Identify all baseline obligations for GPAI model providers under Article 53
- Prepare compliant technical documentation for GPAI models
- Develop effective copyright compliance policies
- Create sufficiently detailed training data summaries
- Establish information-sharing frameworks with downstream providers
- Navigate the reduced obligations for open-source GPAI models

---

Article 53 establishes the baseline obligations applicable to **all** providers of General-Purpose AI models. These requirements apply regardless of whether the GPAI model presents systemic risk, creating a foundation of transparency and accountability across the GPAI ecosystem.

## Overview of Article 53 Obligations

### The Four Core Obligations

| Obligation | Article Reference | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Technical Documentation** | Article 53(1)(a), Annex XI | Enable regulatory oversight and enforcement |
| **Information for Downstream Providers** | Article 53(1)(b), Annex XII | Enable downstream AI Act compliance |
| **Copyright Policy** | Article 53(1)(c) | Ensure copyright law compliance |
| **Training Data Summary** | Article 53(1)(d) | Public transparency on training data |

## Technical Documentation (Article 53(1)(a))

### Annex XI Requirements

GPAI providers must draw up and keep up-to-date technical documentation containing at minimum:

| Documentation Element | Required Content |
| --- | --- |
| **General Description** | GPAI model identification, version, release date, intended uses |

## Information for Downstream Providers (Article 53(1)(b))

### Annex XII Requirements

Providers must provide information and documentation to downstream providers that enables them to:

| Purpose | Required Information |
| --- | --- |
| **Understand the model** | Capabilities, limitations, intended uses |
| **Comply with AI Act** | Information needed for their own compliance |
| **Integrate safely** | Integration guidelines, API documentation |
| **Manage risks** | Known risks, recommended mitigations |

### Information Package Components

**Model Card (Essential):**

| Section | Content |
| --- | --- |
| **Model Details** | Name, version, release date, provider |
| **Intended Use** | Primary intended uses, appropriate downstream applications |
| **Out-of-Scope Use** | Uses not suitable for the model |
| **Limitations** | Known failure modes, accuracy limitations |
| **Risks** | Potential harms, bias concerns |
| **Recommendations** | Best practices for safe deployment |
| **Technical Specifications** | Input/output formats, API details |
| **Training Data** | High-level description of training data |
| **Evaluation Results** | Benchmark performance, safety evaluations |
| **Environmental Impact** | Training compute, carbon footprint |

**Integration Documentation:**

- API specifications and endpoints
- Rate limits and usage guidelines
- Authentication and security requirements
- Error handling procedures
- Versioning and deprecation policies
- Support channels and escalation paths

### Downstream Provider Communication

| Communication Type | Frequency | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Initial onboarding** | At relationship start | Full documentation package |
| **Version updates** | Each significant release | Change logs, migration guidance |
| **Safety notices** | As discovered | Newly identified risks, mitigations |
| **Compliance updates** | Regulatory changes | Updated compliance guidance |
| **Incident notifications** | As incidents occur | Impact assessment, remediation |

> ⚠️ **Compliance Critical:** Article 53(1)(b) creates an ongoing obligation. Information must be updated as the model evolves and new risks or limitations are discovered.

## Copyright Policy (Article 53(1)(c))

### Copyright Compliance Requirements

GPAI providers must establish and implement a policy to comply with Union copyright law, including:

| Requirement | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **TDM Opt-Out Identification** | Detect and respect robots.txt, TDM opt-outs |
| **Rights Holder Communication** | Process for rights holder inquiries |
| **Content Exclusion** | Exclude opted-out content from training |
| **Documentation** | Record compliance measures |

### Text and Data Mining (TDM) Framework

**Directive (EU) 2019/790 Context:**

| TDM Right | Application to GPAI |
| --- | --- |
| **Article 3** | TDM for research—exception for research organisations |
| **Article 4** | Commercial TDM—permitted unless rights holder opts out |
| **Opt-Out Mechanisms** | Machine-readable reservations must be respected |

### Implementing Copyright Compliance

**Copyright Policy Components:**

1. **Data Collection Procedures**
   - Crawler configuration to detect opt-outs
   - robots.txt interpretation guidelines
   - TDM reservation detection methods

2. **Exclusion Mechanisms**
   - Automatic filtering of opted-out content
   - Manual review process for unclear cases
   - Content removal procedures

3. **Rights Holder Communication**
   - Inquiry response process
   - Content takedown procedures
   - Dispute resolution mechanism

4. **Documentation and Records**
   - Training data provenance tracking
   - Opt-out compliance records
   - Audit trail for compliance verification

> 💡 **Practical Guidance:** Implement both technical measures (robots.txt parsing, opt-out detection) and organisational measures (rights holder inquiry process, content removal procedures).

## Training Data Summary (Article 53(1)(d))

### Public Disclosure Requirement

GPAI providers must make **publicly available** a sufficiently detailed summary of the content used for training the GPAI model.

### "Sufficiently Detailed" Standard

The summary must enable understanding of:

| Aspect | Required Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Data Sources** | Categories of sources (web, books, code repositories) |
| **Data Types** | Text, images, audio, code, structured data |
| **Geographic/Linguistic Scope** | Languages covered, regional focus |
| **Time Period** | Date range of training data |
| **Data Volume** | Approximate size (tokens, images, hours) |
| **Curation Methods** | Filtering, cleaning, deduplication approaches |
| **Sensitive Categories** | Handling of personal data, harmful content |

### Training Data Summary Template

```
TRAINING DATA SUMMARY
[Model Name] - [Version] - [Date]

1. DATA SOURCES
   - Web crawl data: ~X TB from common crawl and proprietary crawls

> ⚠️ **Important:** The AI Office will publish a template for the training data summary. Providers should prepare detailed summaries now and adjust to the official template when published.

## Open Source GPAI Provisions (Article 53(2))

### Reduced Obligations for Open Source

**Article 53(2)** provides that providers of GPAI models released under free and open source licences, where model parameters are made publicly available, only need to comply with:

| Obligation | Applies to Open Source? |
| --- | --- |
| Technical documentation (Annex XI) | **No** (reduced) |
| Downstream provider information (Annex XII) | **No** (reduced) |
| Copyright policy | **Yes** |
| Training data summary | **Yes** |

### Conditions for Open Source Exemption

| Criterion | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Licence** | Free and open source licence |
| **Model Parameters** | Made publicly available |
| **No Systemic Risk** | Model does not present systemic risk |
| **Commercial Independence** | Not making the model available through service generating revenue |

### Important Limitations

> ⚠️ **Warning:** The open source exemption does **NOT** apply if:
> - The GPAI model presents systemic risk (Article 55 obligations apply in full)
> - The model is made available through services generating revenue
> - Model parameters are not truly publicly available
