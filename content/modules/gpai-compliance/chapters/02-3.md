# Systemic Risk Classification (Article 51)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Define "systemic risk" under the AI Act framework

- Identify factors that may trigger Commission designation
- Execute notification obligations to the AI Office
- Monitor models for approaching systemic risk thresholds
- Understand the consequences of systemic risk classification

Article 51 introduces a critical distinction within the GPAI framework: models presenting "systemic risk" face significantly enhanced obligations. This tiered approach reflects the EU's recognition that the most capable AI models may pose risks at a societal scale.

## Understanding Systemic Risk

### Article 51(1) Definition

A GPAI model presents **systemic risk** if it has **high-impact capabilities** that could have a significant impact on the Union market due to its reach, or due to actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects on:

| Risk Category | Examples of Potential Impact |
| --- | --- |
| **Public health** | Generating misleading health information at scale |
| **Safety** | Enabling creation of dangerous materials or weapons |
| **Public security** | Large-scale disinformation campaigns |
| **Fundamental rights** | Mass surveillance capabilities, discrimination |
| **Society as a whole** | Economic disruption, democratic process interference |

### "High-Impact Capabilities" Interpretation

| Indicator | Assessment Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| **Scale of deployment** | Millions of users, broad integration |
| **Capability breadth** | Wide range of sophisticated tasks |
| **Reasoning ability** | Complex multi-step reasoning |
| **Autonomous action** | Ability to act with minimal human direction |
| **Knowledge synthesis** | Combining information across domains |
| **Code generation** | Creating functional software, exploits |
| **Persuasion** | Sophisticated content generation |
| **Multimodality** | Integration of text, image, audio, video |

## The 10^25 FLOPS Threshold (Article 51(2))

### Computational Threshold Rule

**Article 51(2)** establishes: A GPAI model shall be **presumed** to have high-impact capabilities when the **cumulative amount of computation** used for its training measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is **greater than 10^25**.

### Understanding the Threshold

| Scale Reference | FLOPS | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Small models** (7B parameters) | ~10^22 | Well below threshold |
| **Medium models** (70B parameters) | ~10^23-10^24 | Below threshold |
| **Large models** (2024 frontier) | ~10^24-10^25 | Near threshold |
| **Systemic risk threshold** | 10^25 | Presumed systemic risk |
| **Future frontier models** | >10^25 | Clearly above threshold |

### What Counts as "Training Compute"?

| Included | Not Included |
| --- | --- |
| Initial pre-training | Inference at deployment |
| Fine-tuning (if substantial) | Minor adaptation/prompting |
| RLHF training | Downstream provider fine-tuning |
| Multi-stage training | Evaluation and testing |
| Distillation (from scratch) | User interactions |

### Calculating Training Compute

**Standard Estimation Formula:**
```
Training FLOPS ≈ 6 × Number of Parameters × Number of Training Tokens
```

**Example Calculation:**
- 70B parameter model trained on 2T tokens
- 6 × 70×10^9 × 2×10^12 = 8.4×10^23 FLOPS
- Below 10^25 threshold

> 💡 **Expert Note:** The 6× multiplier accounts for forward and backward passes plus optimizer operations. Actual compute may vary based on architecture and training approach.

## Commission Designation (Article 51(1)(b))

### Alternative Classification Path

Even if a model does **not** exceed 10^25 FLOPS, the Commission may designate it as presenting systemic risk based on:

| Criterion | Assessment Factors |
| --- | --- |
| **Number of parameters** | Model size and complexity |
| **Quality of dataset** | Breadth, depth, and curation of training data |
| **Size of dataset** | Volume of training data |
| **Input/output modalities** | Text, image, audio, video, code capabilities |
| **Benchmarks** | Performance on capability evaluations |
| **Reach** | Number of users, integrations, deployments |
| **Number of registered users** | Business scale and market penetration |
| **High-impact capabilities** | Assessed dangerous or transformative capabilities |

### Designation Process

| Step | Actor | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | AI Office | Identifies potential systemic risk based on criteria |
| **2** | AI Office | Initiates investigation and evidence gathering |
| **3** | Scientific Panel | Provides technical assessment and recommendations |
| **4** | Commission | Issues designation decision |
| **5** | Provider | May challenge designation (Article 51(3)) |

### Challenging a Designation

**Article 51(3)** provides that providers may request the Commission to reconsider a designation decision if they can demonstrate that the model does not present systemic risk. Evidence may include:

- Independent capability evaluations
- Safety testing results
- Limitation demonstrations
- Use case restrictions
- Technical safeguards implemented

## Notification Requirements (Article 52)

### Mandatory Notification

**Article 52(1)** requires GPAI providers to notify the AI Office:

| Trigger | Timeline |
| --- | --- |
| Model meets 10^25 FLOPS threshold | **Within 2 weeks** of meeting threshold |
| Reasonable grounds to believe threshold will be met | **Before** training completion |
| Commission designation received | Immediate acknowledgment required |

### Notification Content

Notification must include:

| Element | Content Required |
| --- | --- |
| **Provider identification** | Legal entity, contact details, authorised representative |
| **Model identification** | Name, version, release date |
| **Training compute** | Cumulative FLOPS calculation and methodology |
| **Capability assessment** | Known capabilities and limitations |
| **Intended distribution** | Market placement plans |
| **Risk assessment** | Initial systemic risk assessment |

## Consequences of Systemic Risk Classification

### Enhanced Obligations

| Baseline GPAI | + Systemic Risk Additions |
| --- | --- |
| Technical documentation | + Model evaluation and adversarial testing |
| Downstream information | + Systemic risk assessment at Union level |
| Copyright policy | + Incident tracking and reporting |
| Training data summary | + Cybersecurity protection |

### Regulatory Scrutiny

| Aspect | Standard GPAI | Systemic Risk GPAI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AI Office oversight** | General | Enhanced monitoring |
| **Evaluation requests** | Ad hoc | Regular requirements possible |
| **Incident reporting** | Via downstream providers | Direct to AI Office |
| **Enforcement focus** | Documentation | Active risk management |

## Monitoring Approaching Threshold

### Internal Monitoring Framework

| Metric | Monitoring Frequency | Threshold Alert |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Training FLOPS accumulated | Daily during training | 10^24 (approaching) |
| Parameter count | Per training iteration | Planning stage |
| Dataset size growth | Weekly | Major expansions |
| Capability evaluations | Per checkpoint | Significant capability gains |
| User/deployment scale | Monthly | Rapid growth |

### Pre-Threshold Preparation

For models approaching 10^25 FLOPS:

- [ ] Begin Article 55 compliance preparation
- [ ] Establish adversarial testing programme
- [ ] Develop systemic risk assessment methodology
- [ ] Implement enhanced incident tracking
- [ ] Review cybersecurity measures
- [ ] Prepare AI Office notification
- [ ] Engage Scientific Panel proactively

## Key Takeaways

- 10^25 FLOPS creates a **presumption** of systemic risk—below-threshold models may still be designated
- Commission can designate models based on multiple factors beyond compute
- Providers must notify the AI Office within 2 weeks of meeting the threshold
- Systemic risk classification triggers Article 55 enhanced obligations
- Providers may challenge designations with evidence that the model does not present systemic risk
