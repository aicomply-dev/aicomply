## The GPAI Value Chain Architecture

The AI Act creates a layered regulatory framework where obligations flow through the AI supply chain. Understanding this architecture is critical for both GPAI providers and downstream integrators.

### Value Chain Participants

| Participant | Role | AI Act Classification | Primary Obligations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **GPAI Provider** | Develops and provides foundation models | Provider of GPAI model | Article 53 (+ Article 55 if systemic risk) |
| **Downstream Provider** | Integrates GPAI into specific applications | Provider of AI system | Depends on classification of resulting system |
| **Product Manufacturer** | Embeds AI system into products | Provider/Manufacturer | Product safety + AI obligations |
| **Deployer** | Uses AI systems in operational context | Deployer | Article 26 (if high-risk) |
| **Distributor/Importer** | Places systems on market without modification | Distributor/Importer | Article 27-28 |

### Integration Scenarios

| Scenario | GPAI Provider | Downstream Provider | Regulatory Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **API Integration** | Provides model via API | Builds application using API | Both have independent obligations |
| **Model Licensing** | Licenses model weights | Fine-tunes and deploys | Downstream provider becomes new provider |
| **Embedded System** | Provides model component | Integrates into product | Product-level obligations apply |
| **Managed Service** | Provides complete managed service | Uses as-is | Deployer obligations for downstream |

---

## GPAI Provider Information Obligations (Article 53)

### Required Information for Downstream Providers

Article 53(1)(b) requires GPAI providers to provide information and documentation to downstream providers. This enables downstream compliance and integration.

| Information Category | Specific Content | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Technical Documentation** | Architecture, training, capabilities | Understanding model behaviour |
| **Capabilities & Limitations** | What model can/cannot do, known weaknesses | Risk assessment for integration |
| **Integration Guidelines** | API specifications, input/output formats, constraints | Correct technical integration |
| **Intended Uses** | Designed-for applications, validated use cases | Scope of safe deployment |
| **Prohibited Uses** | Applications provider prohibits, high-risk limitations | Risk boundaries |
| **Compliance Information** | Provider's compliance status, CE marking (if applicable) | Regulatory chain |

### Documentation Quality Standards

| Standard | Requirement | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Accuracy** | Information must be correct and verifiable | Downstream reliance |
| **Completeness** | Cover all aspects downstream needs for compliance | Enabling compliance |
| **Clarity** | Accessible to technical and compliance staff | Practical usability |
| **Currency** | Updated when model changes significantly | Ongoing relevance |
| **Specificity** | Sufficient detail for integration decisions | Informed choices |

> **Expert Insight:** "Model cards" have emerged as an industry standard for capability documentation. While the AI Act doesn't mandate a specific format, well-structured model cards often satisfy Article 53 information requirements. However, they must be substantive—a superficial marketing document won't suffice.

## Downstream Provider Obligations

### When Integration Creates Provider Status

Downstream providers who integrate GPAI models become "providers" of the resulting AI system under the AI Act. This triggers independent obligations regardless of the upstream provider's compliance.

| Integration Activity | Provider Status | Obligations Triggered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Building application on GPAI API | Provider of AI system | Depends on system classification |
| Fine-tuning and deploying GPAI model | Provider of AI system | Depends on system classification |
| Using GPAI in high-risk application | Provider of high-risk AI system | Full Article 16 obligations |
| Embedding GPAI in safety component | Provider under product safety law | Product safety + AI Act |

### High-Risk Classification Trigger Points

When downstream integration results in a high-risk AI system, the downstream provider bears full high-risk provider obligations:

| Annex III Category | Example GPAI Integration | Downstream Obligation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Biometrics (Remote ID)** | GPAI for facial recognition | Full conformity assessment required |
| **Critical Infrastructure** | GPAI for grid management | Safety-critical compliance |
| **Education** | GPAI for exam grading | Fairness and oversight requirements |
| **Employment** | GPAI for CV screening | Non-discrimination compliance |
| **Essential Services** | GPAI for credit scoring | Transparency and explanation |
| **Law Enforcement** | GPAI for predictive policing | Enhanced scrutiny and limitations |
| **Migration** | GPAI for visa assessment | Due process requirements |
| **Justice** | GPAI for sentencing assistance | Human oversight mandatory |

### Independent Compliance Requirements

| Requirement | GPAI Provider Contribution | Downstream Provider Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Risk Management** | Information about known risks | Complete system-level risk assessment |
| **Data Governance** | Training data information | Application-specific data governance |
| **Technical Documentation** | Model documentation | System-level documentation |
| **Record-Keeping** | Model training records | System operation logs |
| **Transparency** | Model capabilities | User-facing disclosure |
| **Human Oversight** | Oversight recommendations | Implementation of oversight |
| **Accuracy & Robustness** | Model benchmarks | System-level validation |

> **Warning:** Downstream providers cannot claim "we just use [GPAI Provider]'s model" as a defence. Integration creates independent responsibility. You must assess the combined system behaviour, not just inherit upstream compliance claims.

## Information Flow Framework

### Upstream Information (GPAI Provider → Downstream)

| Information Type | Format | Update Frequency | Obligation Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Technical documentation | Structured document/API | On significant changes | Article 53(1)(b) |
| Capability descriptions | Model card format | Version updates | Article 53(1)(b) |
| Limitation disclosures | Technical advisory | As discovered | Ongoing duty |
| Risk warnings | Security advisory format | As identified | Article 53(1)(b) |
| Integration guidelines | Developer documentation | API changes | Article 53(1)(b) |
| Usage restrictions | Terms of service/licence | Policy changes | Article 53(1)(b) |

### Downstream Information Needs Assessment

| Downstream Use Case | Critical Information Needs | Risk Assessment Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Consumer Application** | Limitations, failure modes, bias risks | User safety, fairness |
| **Enterprise Tool** | Accuracy, reliability, security | Business risk, data protection |
| **High-Risk System** | Full technical detail, validation data | Conformity assessment |
| **Safety-Critical** | Failure modes, edge cases, worst-case behaviour | Safety margins |

### Information Gap Remediation

When GPAI provider information is insufficient:

| Gap | Downstream Action | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing capability data | Request from provider; conduct own testing | Testing records |
| Unknown limitations | Conservative assumptions; additional safeguards | Risk assessment rationale |
| Unclear integration guidance | Technical consultation; pilot testing | Integration validation |
| Absent risk information | Independent risk assessment | Risk register |

---

## Contractual Framework Design

### Essential Contract Elements

| Element | Purpose | Key Provisions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Information Rights** | Ensure adequate information flow | Right to technical documentation, updates, audit |
| **Notification Duties** | Timely awareness of changes | Model updates, vulnerability disclosure, incident alerts |
| **Cooperation Requirements** | Enable downstream compliance | Conformity assessment support, audit cooperation |
| **Liability Allocation** | Clear responsibility boundaries | Indemnification, limitation of liability, insurance |
| **Audit Rights** | Verification capability | Access to documentation, testing rights |
| **Termination Provisions** | Orderly transition | Notice periods, data retention, migration support |

### Model Terms Framework

| Use Case | Recommended Contract Type | Key Protections |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **API Access** | Service agreement with SLA | Uptime, support, information updates |
| **Model Licensing** | Licence agreement with compliance addendum | Documentation rights, modification restrictions |
| **Managed Service** | Master service agreement | End-to-end obligations, incident response |
| **Partnership** | Strategic partnership agreement | Joint compliance framework, shared development |

### Liability Considerations

| Scenario | Potential GPAI Provider Liability | Potential Downstream Liability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Model defect** | High—if undisclosed | Low—if properly documented reliance |
| **Integration error** | Low—if proper guidance provided | High—implementation responsibility |
| **Misuse by end user** | Variable—depends on warnings | High—deployment responsibility |
| **High-risk non-compliance** | Contributory—if inadequate information | Primary—as system provider |
| **Regulatory penalties** | Direct if own obligations breached | Direct for own obligations |

> **Expert Insight:** Contract negotiations often focus on liability caps and indemnification. For AI Act compliance purposes, focus equally on information rights and cooperation obligations. Without adequate information flow, downstream compliance is impossible regardless of liability allocation.

## Coordination Mechanisms

### Incident Response Coordination

| Phase | GPAI Provider Role | Downstream Provider Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Detection** | Model-level monitoring | System-level monitoring |
| **Notification** | Alert downstream of model issues | Report system incidents |
| **Investigation** | Model-level analysis | System-level analysis |
| **Remediation** | Model patches, mitigations | System updates, workarounds |
| **Communication** | Coordinate messaging | User notification |

### Ongoing Coordination Activities

| Activity | Frequency | Participants | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Technical Updates** | As needed | Engineering teams | Updated documentation |
| **Security Briefings** | Quarterly or as needed | Security teams | Threat landscape updates |
| **Compliance Reviews** | Annual | Compliance teams | Compliance status assessment |
| **Capability Updates** | Per release | Product teams | Release notes, capability changes |
| **Incident Reviews** | Post-incident | Response teams | Lessons learned |

---

## Special Considerations

### Open-Source GPAI and Downstream Obligations

When integrating open-source GPAI models under Article 53(2) exemption:

| Consideration | Implication for Downstream |
| --- | --- |
| Limited provider obligations upstream | Downstream must conduct own due diligence |
| No commercial support guarantee | Higher self-reliance requirement |
| Community-based updates | Active monitoring of community channels |
| Potential licence restrictions | Compliance with open-source licence terms |
| Variable documentation quality | May require own capability assessment |

### Multi-Tier Value Chains

Complex value chains with multiple integration layers:

| Tier | Example | Obligations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tier 1** | GPAI foundation model provider | Article 53 to immediate downstream |
| **Tier 2** | Vertical application developer | Provider obligations + pass-through information |
| **Tier 3** | System integrator | Provider obligations for combined system |
| **Tier 4** | Deployer organisation | Deployer obligations (Article 26 if high-risk) |

Each tier inherits responsibility for ensuring adequate information reaches subsequent tiers.
